{"post_type":"s","created_utc":1727747693.0,"subreddit":"Autism_Parenting","author":"Mindless_Homework","link_flair":"Aggression","title":"Safety concerns ","selftext":"Hi everyone. Today was a rough day. I have a 14 year old son, he is non speaking and low functioning. I apologize because this may be lengthy. \n\nUpon the arrival of his bus, he was immediately agitated. That\u2019s not abnormal. He doesn\u2019t sleep well a lot of the time. And yes, he is on several prescription medications for sleep, anxiety and mood. As soon as he boarded, he pinched the driver and started to go for the para that helps on the bus. They\u2019re both very patient with him. He did sit and buckle, but that lasted maybe ten seconds. The bus drove past the neighboring home, and then threw it in reverse. He\u2019d unbuckled and went after the para. They asked me to remove him from the bus because it wasn\u2019t safe for anyone on the bus if that\u2019s how he decided to act. \n\nMy younger son (12) walks a few houses down to catch his bus, I have always waited with him. His father and step mother do not, they just send him on his way and they\u2019ve done that for years. So I felt horrible having to leave him even if it was less than five minutes before the bus came. \n\nI drove my older son to school. He had my phone so he could watch caillou. During the drive to school, he did pinch me several times. When I say pinch, he really does damage and the bruising lasts for weeks. He is bigger than me, but even when he wasn\u2019t, he\u2019s always been able to inflict serious damage when he feels like doing so. When I arrived at school, I parked in the designated area for student drop off. I had to practically wrestle the phone from him to call his classroom to let them know I had him as a car drop off this morning. It\u2019s the protocol. Roughly ten minutes later, his teacher called and she and a large male para came to assist me in getting him safely into school. \n\nOnce I returned home, I sent a text to my ex husband to let him know what had occurred and I stated I feel like I am\nConstantly put into potentially very dangerous situations due to our son\u2019s behavior. My suggestion was that I drop our children off to him on Sunday evening during the school year as our son tends to act quite differently at his father\u2019s home. Our son has always seemed happier at his father\u2019s. We have rules in our home, and it\u2019s kind of lawless at my ex husband\u2019s so there are far fewer restrictions there. In my home, we have safe areas for my son, we have routine. It\u2019s not the same when he is at his dad\u2019s. \n\nMy suggestion was met with aggression from my ex husband. No big surprise to me as that\u2019s how most our important conversations go. I\u2019ve told him over and over it is not safe for me, my younger son or anyone on the road when my older son decides to act out in the car. It is not safe when he acts out violently towards me or his brother in our home. Every suggestion I\u2019ve made for a decade to try to make life easier for everyone (that\u2019s how long we have been divorced and sharing custody) has been shot down by my ex husband. \n\nI am supposed to speak with my ex husband one on one this Wednesday and I have something written up to present him. I don\u2019t know what else I can say or do to impress upon him that our older son might be better off living with dad full time as he rarely has aggressions there. \n\nAll of this is well documented with my personal physicians, psychiatrist, therapist, teachers. My ex husband and his wife both work in healthcare and I feel like they should kind of know better and be better than this. Our son routinely sees a developmental pediatrician and she says he acts out like this with me because he\u2019s most comfortable with me. I don\u2019t really fully believe that statement to be true. \n\nI live in fear of my son. My younger son is also fearful of his brother. My ex husband really acts like none of this is a big deal\nSince it doesn\u2019t happen under his roof and he doesn\u2019t see it occur. \n\nI could use some advice. I am happy to share screenshots of my text exchange I had today as well as the letter I wrote suggesting a change. \n\nIf you made it this far, thank you. I appreciate any feedback.

","selftext":"\n\n\n\nI was bitten at some point probably in either very early 2024 or very late 2023 by a child (who has autism) at my job. I hadn\u2019t been told the child *could* bite me, and was 18 at the time. I had been helping out two teachers with the child because the child needed the extra support after the BT left. I remember a coworker of mine mentioned the other day that the fact that I\u2019m not trained to work with the child (other than CPR\/First Aid training) is bad - that they \u201cthrew me in\u201d and shouldn\u2019t have when I lack experience. They pointed out that they didn\u2019t know how to handle it when they were bitten for the first time by a student, and think they would have benefitted from training around proper protocol. They also pointed out that they weren\u2019t told to write an incident report.\n\nI had once mentioned to this coworker that I remember, maybe a week after I was bitten, that my boss said that if one of their employees had pushed down a child who bit them (the child\u2019s former BT did this) they\u2019d possibly give them a warning, but would realistically fire them. They looked at me when they said this. I had mentioned to the coworker at some point that I didn\u2019t think it was fair or sensible to fire someone, especially not a young person, when you haven\u2019t told them a bite was possible and haven\u2019t trained them around the issue. I actually really do think it is best to train employees around this. The coworker suggested mentioning it as constructive criticism. \n\nToday, the child grabbed my neck a few times - kind of like a choking motion if I hadn\u2019t stopped them first - while I was trying to change their diaper. Another teacher noticed this (teacher mentioned to me that the child has tried doing this before while with them) and did help me out with the diaper change. The child had also hit me, and I could tell they were very dysregulated in general during the diaper change. I actually asked my bosses after everything that happened today if they could implement some sort of training procedure for any employees of theirs. No one has responded. I was removed from Brightwheel earlier today as well, but that actually makes sense since I communicated today that my last day will be Friday. I\u2019m displeased about the fact that no one has responded\u2026 but the coworker I talked to had mentioned that they didn\u2019t have them write an incident report after they were bitten once, so this is no shocker. My bosses have not responded (last message was sent 2-3 hours ago.) \n\nMy new job will train me around how to handle situations like this. They have specific training when it comes to bites and any other physical aggression. I suspect that the fact that my current job doesn\u2019t train around this will cause problems for them in the future.

I started dating a guy, and he has an autistic son. I met my partner when his son (i am going to call gary) was 14. \nWhen I met Gary, we got on great. But he had the dependency level of a toddler. He couldn't wipe himself after going to the toilet, couldn't be left for long periods and both his dad and especially his mum, seemed to have no interest in giving him the tools he needs to be an adult and take care of himself. \n\nAnyway, we have Gary almost every weekend, in the holidays e.c.t. I also have two kids who are 8 and 10. So I would do things like make them clean up after themselves, put their own washing away, and help cook. \n\nWhen my partner moved in Gary ended up spending a lot of time here and I got him doing the same sort of stuff because thats fair. \n\nHe recently started college a few miles from my house. Now both his parents work full time. I work part time because my kids are young. But I worked to get myself in a position where I could be part time and be present for my kids. I am also currently doing a degree so that when my boys are big enough that I can go back to work full time, I can move into a sector I enjoy.\n\nFor months and months before he started college I told his dad that he and Garys mum needed to teach him how to use the bus and neither of them did sweet fa. So when he started college, I said I didn't mind picking him up for a few weeks but they needed to tech him how to use the bus or else I wouldn't help and they could sort it out between themselves.\nSo they started to teach him\n\nMy problem here is that I am not his parent. I do not mind being supportive of his parents but he is not my child. I am just getting to a point where I can see my kids going off and doing their own thing, giving me more freedom to do mine. My partner is supposed to be doing the same with Gary but honestly, it feels like he can't\/won't do it. Gary's mum in her mind is perfect, and I think she must think he will magically learn?! She does everything for him because that's easier than actually having to teach him to do it for himself.\n\nThis breaks my heart for one reason. They are doing Gary a massive disservice. I know it takes him longer to learn things, But there are things he has to learn to be able to survive by himself. There is no reason Gary can't live a independent life. He seems to want to learn! But his parents dont\/wont teach him. I worry what will happen when both his mum and dad are gone and he has to fend for himself. It's not a matter of if, but when. I shouldn't have to take on effectively raising Gary because his parents are rubbish. \n\nHis mum is selfish. She doesn't want him to grow up because she gets the best of both worlds. She gets to be his mum monday to friday and she gets to do what she wants on a weekend.\n\nShe is planning on moving much further away and Gary has (not in so many words) said he wants to live with us in the week to go to college, and then go to his mums on a weekend. I honestly think he will just end up living here for the majority of time because he will be left all alone. Whereas, he has a great relationship with my kids, we have animals which he adores and his mum won't allow pets. It honestly feels like, he has turned 18 she has checked out as a parent.\n\nI feel like if I don't 'raise' him, no one will and I feel guilty because I think if no one is gonna teach him, I should. But I have my own things I want to do and why should that be my responsibility? He has two parents. Both of them should do better. His dad has gotten better but still isn't great and his mum thinks she is the best parent in the world so she doesn't need to change.\n\nI am also annoyed because I was supposed to collect Gary from college and he had stayed off cause he was sick. He didn't tell me and neither did his mum (his dad didn't know). His mum says she told him so he should have done it. Which i agree with, but I still think she should have followed up because she knew he was likely to forget and I wasted over an hour of my time and my youngest sons time because she couldn't be bothered to text to make sure Gary had told me. Which just makes me feel really angry and annoyed because she didn't even think about it.\n\nI don't know what to do. Should I take a step back or not?

This IS improving and he\u2019s recently taken interest in toy cars.\nOther than the obvious lack of speech, he is an extremely loving little boy who loves to play with other kids, loves playing with his brother and being outside. He is on the pathway for Autism assessment (we are in the UK) which could take up to 3 years.\nOriginally I had my son at the local preschool and he was thriving. They had no problems with him at all. Unfortunately due to a family death we had to move to a completely new area and find him a new preschool.\nThe first place we looked at was ideally located next to my older son\u2019s new school and I made an enquiry for a space. They told me they had space for him and to come for a tour which we did. Everything was fine, I explained his delays and what his last preschool were doing with him etc and all was fine until I took the enrolment forms back- it was really obvious to me that the enthusiasm they had at the beginning was gone and I had a sudden gut feeling they were going to tell me they didn\u2019t have space for him despite telling me they did. \nI waited for 3 weeks, sent emails asking if they could update me which were ignored mostly until a full month later they told me they didn\u2019t have space for him due to \u201cstaffing issues\u201d. \nI fully understand that in order to operate they need a good number of staff in order to properly care for the children they have with them- I am more than understanding that some children (including my own son) require extra support and that means more staff- I absolutely get it, but this felt off to me from the beginning. \nSo I looked at other preschools and nurseries and made enquiries and told them all about my son\u2019s delays with speech etc and we were invited to two other tours, discussed everything and told to fill out forms and send them in. I did all of that 3 more times and still I have no responses from them. \nAll of these preschools told me they have spaces available, the last two said they have enough staff to provide extra support If need be, yet non of them get back to me.

His teacher convinced us to switch to a contained classroom at a special ed school (8:1:2) because she believed the extra support would help him thrive. I, too, was optimistic and hopeful it would help.\n\nThe past month has been hard.

We get little communication from his teacher besides him recently crying a lot at school.\n\nI fully expected hiccups during a transition period at a new school but it is so heartbreaking to see. My husband thinks I\u2019m overreacting because I want to pull him out of the school if things don\u2019t improve.

His school teachers recommended signing him up for extra curricular classes to help him improve his social skills and physical activity.\n\nWhenever he starts a new class, whether it's school, summer camp, or an extracurricular activity, he tends to be reluctant at first, often saying that he doesn\u2019t have friends or that no one plays with him. However, he usually warms up over time, finds one or two kids to connect with, and eventually starts enjoying himself once the routine sets in.\n\nRecently, we signed him up for Taekwondo after he showed a lot of enthusiasm, having read about Karate in some comics and getting excited about it. He went without any issues on the first day which was a big win. Usually he doesn't agree to these easily.   \n  \nBut by the second and third day, he saw other kids in the mixed-level class getting promoted to new belts, which upset him. He felt like he had \"failed\" because he wasn\u2019t promoted too, and it led to a meltdown where he cried for 30 minutes, saying he didn\u2019t want to go back.\n\nWe tried to explain that Taekwondo is about learning and having fun, and that progress takes time. While he calmed down eventually and returned to his regular evening routine, I\u2019m concerned he won\u2019t want to go back to class.\n\nFrom experience, I know that if he sticks with it for a few week or so, he\u2019ll likely start enjoying it, but I\u2019m struggling with how to encourage him to push through these first few tough weeks.\n\nHas anyone else faced a similar situation with their child? How can I help him stay motivated, especially since he was so excited initially? Any tips for helping him manage these feelings of failure would be greatly appreciated.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1fu3v0s\/how_can_i_motivate_my_8yearold_with_asd_to_stick\/","main_id":"1fu3v0s","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-02 00:43:55"}

There are extra challenges with him that I don't see any of the parents around me having and sometimes I feel like a failure. Especially when I spend time on social media seeing post after post on proper, good parenting. My kid gets too much screen time. Sometimes all he will eat is peanut butter straight off a spoon. Sometimes he has tantrums that no gentle parenting tips can curb. Reading the experiences of other parents has been the most validating thing. For the first time in years I feel like I'm not screwing up my kid and feel more confident in following my instincts when he needs something that is not recommended for the 'average' kid. The most notable for me is screen time, which his dad and i really rely on for a little bit of a break and some quiet hands off time. I have dealt with so much internal conflict over allowing him screen time. Hearing that other parents rely on it as well has changed my perspective and allowed me to let go of some of that guilt.

I am not specifically looking for advice but just want to know that I am not unique\/alone.\n\nMy son just turned 15.  He is mostly nonverbal.  He will ask for things he wants but not always use the right want.  His main words are asking for \"suckers\" which is basically anything in the cabinet we have locked up (chips, candy, etc).  His second most common ask is for tickles or fight which means tickles.\n\nHe is a sweet kid but is completely oblivious to the consequences of actions or the feeling of others.  If I get hurt he would laugh because he doesn't recognize my response as being the same as when he is hurt.  It is almost impossible to teach him anything.  He will pour out a case of bubly then ask me for bubly because he is thirsty.  Same with Parmesan cheese.  These are just examples.  He seems to not get the connection between the two and that frustrates me to no end.  It is clear that every EC teacher ultimately gets frustrated with him as well and most only last a year.  That at least gives us a feeling that it is not just us.  The experts don't really know how to teach him.\n\nHe is also about 6'2\" and weighs over 220.  Luckily he is not very aggressive but you are not getting him to do something (like getting out of the car at school) he doesn't want to do.\n\nThe most frustrating thing is that he is unintentionally very destructive.  Our 12 year old house is a mess.  He constantly floods our hardwood floor kitchen, tears up our screens on the porch, ripping out the spline from window screens, etc.  (I replaced the porch screens with expensive pet friendly screens and that seems to have solved that problem.). None of it is intentionally destructive.\n\nMy wife and I have been separated for about six years. She asked me to move out because she met someone else.  I honestly think that she needed a break and separating gave her (and me) a break 50% of the time.  We go back and forth between our house (where our son stays) and an apartment.

We finally had our son's evaluation. I booked the appointment almost eight months ago, so it was a long time in coming. \n\nWe went to a pediatric neuropsychologist because getting in to see a developmental pediatrician in our state is almost impossible. We've been seeing a neurodevelopmental nurse practitioner through our local Children's Hospital since December (at 2.5 years old), but we're on the waiting list for their ASD evaluation and the NP told me that they probably wouldn't get to my son until he was 4. So in February, I took matters into my own hands and we decided to see a neuropsychologist separate from the hospital. \n\nAt the end of the evaluation, she gave us her preliminary thoughts. She is diagnosing him as level 1 autistic, and said his presentation is very mild. We will be meeting with her in a couple of weeks to talk about the report in-depth. \n\nI don't feel grief or heaviness today, although believe me, I've felt those plenty over the last eight months. I feel relief and validation. I'm proud of how well my son handled everything (his IEP evaluation was disastrous compared to this). I'm glad that this diagnosis will give us and others a better understanding of him. We won't be doing anything differently in terms of therapies. He's been in speech and OT 2x\/week since December, and as of September, he's got an IEP at the public preschool and we added private music therapy. He's really made so much progress this year.\n\nI wanted to share this with parents who would understand.

Any advice?","selftext":"TLDR: I recently learned I'm Autistic and my world view is suddenly blown apart. I need help figuring out how to \"translate\" the questions doctors ask based on a NT standpoint so that I can answer them properly and help my son get a diagnosis.\n\nSo as the title says, I've recently learned I'm autistic (self diagnosed and my ADHD doc agreed, but decided not to do a full evaluation due to cost and stage of life). It's been a question in the back of my mind for a long time, but due to trauma and masking, I was able to blend just enough to appear NT. Now that I have confirmed my own autism, I've been realizing how many things I've struggled with that I didn't realize I was and learning that I don't understand social cues, norms, etc nearly as well as I thought I did. One of my main issues with how this affects my son, is that when doctors would ask questions, I answered them based on my interpretation, which was apparently wrong for so many things, and that led to them saying my son just has severe ADHD, no autism. However I now know that I've misunderstood many of these questions and how I would rate my son's and my own ability to relate to others socially, is actually incorrect based on a NT standpoint. So I think based on the many questions I've been asked regarding my son, I've accidentally described him to be more in line with NT standards than he actually is, which I believe has led to his doctors saying it wasn't worth it to look into an autism diagnosis. I am certain that my son is Autistic along with his ADHD. I just feel like I need to learn more about what the NT standard actually is for these questions so I can answer them properly so that he can be helped. Does anyone have any advice on how I can go about this? I feel like we've been so dismissed by a lot of professionals, I want to be fully prepared before I really push for this again. I hope this makes sense, I'm having a hard time putting this into the proper wording.\nSome examples:\n\n-\"Does your child avoid eye contact?\" I would answer \"not always\" which led doctors to lean toward ADHD, getting distracted, etc. When in reality compared to NT, yes he avoids eye contact MUCH more than NT children typically do, but because he occasionally can hold eye contact, he has the ability to, which in my mind meant that this was not a struggle for him.\n\n-\"Does your child make friends?\" I would answer yes, he has always had 1 or 2 very close friends each year in school. However, he does not know how to initiate friendship, proper communication skills with peers, if another child actually is his friend or not (considers some bullies to be his friend, misinterprets things some of his actual friends say incorrectly leading him to believe they aren't friends) etc. But because he can have some friendships, I would always say yes, thinking the struggles he has here are \"normal NT behavior.\"\n\nThere's so many more, but I'm blanking right now. Anyway, any help in decoding NT communication would be great so I can get my son the help he needs.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1fumxb0\/ive_recently_learned_im_autistic_and_i_think_ive\/","main_id":"1fumxb0","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-02 18:10:47"}

And his friend bent his finger backwards. Understandably, I was concerned and insisted on a quick response from the school. \n\nThe dean of students called me today, having reviewed the tape. Know what happened? A kid accidentally hit his foot when running by. Then another kid accidentally landed on him after jumping off something. Two boys tried to help him up. When the one who landed on him came up, he yelled at him. No attempting to kick him. And then he told his friend that his finger hurt, and her \u2014 being 10 \u2014 took it and bent it back like, \u201cDoes it hurt like this?\u201d \n\nMy husband says he\u2019s filtering everything through this extreme lens of all the kids being out to get him. \n\nI should have known better, as it\u2019s not the first time something like this has happened. But I\u2019m so angry. \n\nHow do I not feel like he\u2019s lying to try and get kids in trouble? How do I ever trust anything he says anymore? When do I get concerned if he\u2019s divorcing from reality? \n\nI just want to yell at him that I\u2019m never going to believe him ever again. Just when I thought our relationship was getting repaired a bit. \n\nI understand this is due to his limitations, and his black and white brain making things fit into his worldview. I\u2019m just so angry. Obviously telling him not to talk to me about these things isn\u2019t wise, but that\u2019s truly what I feel like doing. It FEELS like he\u2019s a liar.

Today in an attempt to stop her biting me, I put my hand over her mouth and told her to stop biting me and to calm down for no longer than five seconds. \n\nWithin that time a lady a few rows back on the bus decided to scream \u201cdo not do that, do not put your hand over her mouth\u201d to which I calmly ignored and after my daughter had finished her episode I turned round, apologised for what it may have looked like and explained she is severely non verbal autistic and has recently become incredibly violent and I was attempting to calm her down. Had she not calmed down (which she thankfully did straight after) she\u2019s actually prone to smashing her head off of stuff and really hurting herself too.

My son is currently using a speech tablet which we are working on trying to use effectively and can verbally say one word things but has a hard time to communicate what he is trying to get across. He has echolalia. My son does have behaviors such as hyper focusing on certain things which make it hard for him to focus. The current curriculum he is in via the public school does have its pros such as working on these behaviors to help him to understand rules, structure etc but I feel that he needs more therapy time than what they are providing via the iep, his iep is mainly having him effectively complete tasks as he struggles mostly in communication. With occupational only being a half hour a week and speech 6 times a month via the iep. His next iep meeting is coming in February.

His eating habits seem to vary from day to day. Sometimes he will go a week or two only wanting one type of food, and the next phase he won't want to eat anything or only single bites of everything. Judging by other comments this seems to be relatively normal, especially since he can't tell us what he wants to eat. Using pictures to point to don't seem to make sense to him, and the types of devices where you press buttons to speak or emote also don't work. \n\nAre there any other methods I could use to try and communicate with him regarding food needs?\n\n3. As far as sleep goes, this is another pain point. When Ric was tested in his younger years he was in the red zone for all of the medications available that I have seen mentioned used for other autistic children and adults. I have read up on the lack of melatonin regulation which may explain what's going on. But regardless he will not go to sleep without repeated comments to go to sleep, and it ends up working around 10pm. Then he's up again at 3-4AM. I think this is also part of the dysregulation because he's so tired. I want to help him go to sleep easier, for both his and Bella's sanity.   \nI don't really agree with sleeping pills on a child so young, and I am mixed on other natural remedies like CBD\/Melatonin gummies since I've seen it can affect mental development before a certain age.\n\nI also want to mention that he does follow a routine every morning or night, but he is very resistant to some of the steps like brushing his teeth or flushing the toilet when he is done using it. \n\nI'm sure I have more questions I want to learn about but that is all I want to post for now. I hope none of this comes across as offensive to anyone. I only want to learn and understand how to better accept, care, support, and empathize with these sorts of diagnoses. I am so new to this.

I was certain since 4 months ago he had autism, so it wasn\u2019t a shock for me. I also kept my family informed what was going on and told them he was formally diagnosed. \n\nMy husband is another story. He tells me he is fine, but he didn\u2019t really accept what was going on with our son prior when I told him multiple times in the past four months he has autism. He kept saying, \u201cyou don\u2019t know,\u201d or \u201cwe will see.\u201d \n\nEven at the end of the eval, the psychologist said he\u2019ll be re evaluated in another year, basically because he is two and non verbal. My husband somehow took that as in a year, they could remove the autism diagnosis. I told him that\u2019s not how it works, this is a life long thing, just as they get older, symptoms change. \n\nAt the moment, I asked him if it\u2019s okay I told his mother about his diagnosis. He made excuses saying he\u2019s busy, I said that\u2019s why I can tell her so any questions can be directed toward me. He continually said he didn\u2019t want to deal with it.w c\n\nIt\u2019s a weird feeling where all my family knows, we can freely talk about it, but his, who has asked about it and would probably accept it, doesn\u2019t know.\n\nWe\u2019ve been to his family functions in the past where my husband basically told me he didn\u2019t want me to talk to them about our son\u2019s issues. It makes it so hard and awkward that I don\u2019t want to go and now don\u2019t want our son to go if he\u2019s not going to accept it. I assume he wants to just carry on like everything is fine.\n\nI\u2019m annoyed, because I\u2019ve been talking about this with him for months, it\u2019s very obvious our son has autism, but I feel he wants me to hide it. \n\nAny advice? Am I being too harsh? I feel all I can do is wait for him to accept it and hopefully tell them, but it could be a month or longer from now, if that.\n\n","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1fvlz8e\/husband_seems_to_be_putting_off_telling_family_of\/","main_id":"1fvlz8e","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-03 23:57:32"}

I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to about this. Our son is 4 and got a diagnosis in January of this year, starting OT, Speech, and ABA at that time. He was in preschool two mornings a week and was doing really well on all fronts! He was making progress in speech, we were addressing behaviors, and he participated and did well at school. \n\nOver the summer we started having difficulty. We chalked it up to a change in his routine and thought he'd adjust to the new routine. He never really did, but I was hopeful he'd be good after starting school again. It's been worse and now he doesn't ever want to go to school and is aggressive and doesn't participate when there. I started thinking back to what happened when all these behaviors started in the summer. I realized that ABA started backing off on demands placed on him. Trying to give him more choices and give back some of the control. \n\nThen we had issues at OT\/Speech when he started resisting. They had a meeting with ABA to try and get on the same page. ABA told them to reduce demands placed on him temporarily. Well now they can't get him back on track at all and are talking about dropping some of his sessions because he's not progressing. They haven't worked on any of his stated OT\/speech goals for the past two months because any attempt to steer him toward one of these activities ends in disaster. ABA told them again today to back off on demands. At this point he's not getting anything from OT\/speech other than play time.\n\nI can't help but feel that ABA is the reason he's not progressing and doing so poorly in school! He's had so few demands placed on him in therapy and at home at the advice and instruction of ABA that now he's encountering demands at school and losing his mind. I feel like ABA should have worked with him on dealing with demands rather than straight up avoiding them! I have no idea what to do at this point. How do I fix this? How do I get him loving school again and be willing to participate?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1fvnw65\/needing_advice_and_perspective_please\/","main_id":"1fvnw65","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-04 01:34:54"}

","selftext":"Our 10 year old autistic son is very high functioning. Most of the time he seems like a smart but shy 10 year old. \n\nBut he has some behaviors that are very stressful to handle, especially for my wife who gets more of it than I do. \n\nHe will often get fixated on something. Today it was a particular flower he saw when riding to school. He wanted his mother to see it, but she didn\u2019t, and he was in a funk the whole time because she missed it. This originally happened two days ago, and he hasn\u2019t let it go. \n\nTonight after piano lessons, his sister (11) got a mint from the bowl and when they got in the car he said he wanted a mint. She tried to give it to him, but he refused to take it. He wanted his own. He would not buckle his seatbelt and my wife ended up yelling at him because he would not buckle. \n\nWhen they got home, my wife and I tried talking with him. He cried, whined, whimpered and said he wanted a mint. I kept trying to give him the mint but he refused it. He gets caught in these loops where he keeps repeating the same two or three phrases. Like \u201cI want a mint\u201d but he won\u2019t take the one we have. Or \u201cI wanted a mint from the piano store\u201d, but we explain that was in the past and we can\u2019t do anything about that now. \n\nThis will usually take 30 or 45 minutes where he argues with us, interrupts us, and accuses us of interrupting him. He can be very rude. He will want to cuddle with my wife, but he pushes me away. \n\nThis is practically an every day occurrence. My wife told me today she hates our son and has \u201cPTSD\u201d from him. She\u2019s always on the lookout to avoid doing anything that\u2019s going to \u201cset him off\u201d. \n\nWe don\u2019t know what to do. We\u2019re conflicted about consequences because we feel we\u2019d be punishing for something he can\u2019t really control. But at the same time, we feel he needs to understand consequences for his behavior. \n\nWe talked about \u201cnatural consequences\u201d but nothing ever fits the simple examples they use in books. Getting a mint from piano lessons is such a one-time obscure situation. We can\u2019t say \u201cwe\u2019re not driving until you buckle up\u201d because that\u2019s exactly what he wants. He doesn\u2019t care. He has no sense of time, or getting home so we can move on to the next activity. \n\nAfter he finally settles down from the mint thing \u2014 he goes into his once a week freak-out wanting \u201cextra time to watch YouTube\u201d. We always tell him consistently that we have the same number of hours every day, mom and I have to work the same hours, school is the same length of time, bedtime wind-down will start at 8:00 (everything electronic is turned off, they have to feed fish, brush their teeth, change into pajamas, etc). If there is time between homework, dinner, bedtime, he can do YouTube or video games. \n\nBut when he knows \u2018he has missed some time\u2019 (in his thinking) he starts asking for extra time, which starts another whining, crying loop, repeating the same 2-3 phrases like a three card Monte routine. We keep trying to tell him, \u201cYou\u2019re literally losing your time right now while you\u2019re arguing with us. You would have plenty of time if you just start YouTube \/ games \/ whatever right now.\u201d \n\nEventually he gets over this. \u201cThe spell breaks\u201d and he goes to get his computer and play Roblox with his friend. I ask if he wants the mint - and he says sure and takes it. \n\nMy wife is losing her mind. I keep trying to take over more - or remind her to share the load. She insists on driving the kids one the two days she doesn\u2019t work. But every one of those trips results in a meltdown - sometimes she can barely get him out of the car at school. And at home, he brings the meltdown inside and follows my wife around, she can\u2019t get away from him. \n\nJust another week dealing with a terrorist.

Every hour or so we go into the bathroom, I help him pull his pants and pull up down, he sits on the potty for a few mins, I wipe him up, help him put on a clean pull up, his pants, he flushes, and washes his hands and then we go back to playing. He\u2019s in ABA 4 hours a day 5 days a week and they do the same thing. He\u2019s still in pull up\u2019s full time. A few months ago, he became dehydrated after being sick, became constipated, struggled to pass a hard stool, and from that point on it\u2019s been hell. He withholds his poops allllll the time, leading to more constipation, then leakage, then a terrible blistered bottom from the constant leakage. It doesn\u2019t matter how frequently I take him to the bathroom or how much Aquaphor or Desitin I put on him, he\u2019s rigid in pain, screaming, crying, it\u2019s so terrible you guys, it\u2019s like someone\u2019s holding a lighter to his skin - that\u2019s what it looks like when I\u2019m trying to wipe him. I am devastated. I am his whole world and he is mine. I am trying so so so hard. If you went through this, please give me some advice. He\u2019s on a daily symbiotic (brand: Seed) and that seemed to help at first. I need help badly but everyone I talk to doesn\u2019t seem to know what to do really besides daily MiraLAX, which we have also tried. Everything helps for a week or two and then we\u2019re back into the same cycle. I\u2019m sorry this is so long, it\u2019s 10pm here. I feel so fried and raw and exhausted and defeated\/ desperate.

Turns out , he repeats words , talk only about cars at school and also did during the evaluation and gets upset when he doesn't get blue colored marker or paper at school. We are a bilingual household and he has been getting exposed to English only at school for 3 hrs each day from the past 1 year .

However this year , his teachers complain every day saying he is academically smart but has trouble making friends and playing so he ends up copying the highest energy child in the class even if that is inappropriate behavior . He has a lot of anxiety and doesn't participate in group discussion . He doesn't look in the eye unless something about cars is mentioned .

Is early intervention necessary?","selftext":"    HI,\n    I am the mother of a baby born in July with some signs (mild micrognathia, mild bilateral pyelectasis and bilateral metatarsus adductus which translated means receding chin, mild enlargement of the kidneys and varus foot).\n    \n    I have the feeling that my son functions differently than other children. Even though I turned to two paediatricians (including the free-choice one) who seem to insist on the importance of waiting because every child has his own time and to a child neuropsychiatrist, I am not at peace. Below are some typical behaviors of my son:\n    when he manages to make eye contact he maintains it but never takes the initiative. He does this especially if stimulated and if his attention is attracted with songs or raspberries or by calling him, or with funny faces. Most of the time he doesn't seem to notice I'm there unless I come into his field of vision. In any case, if my neighbor deliberately avoids my gaze and sometimes cries. He doesn't seem interested in other people unless they enter into a 1:1 relationship. I'll give you an example: we were in the hospital, there were other children and he never looked at them. A lady approached him, spoke to him and he smiled at her.\n    He catches the toys with his gaze and is able to follow the object, this is evident with black and white flash cards or, in general, with the pictures in books.\n    when I meet his gaze and smile at him he gives me beautiful moments, returning his smile and vocalizing (in fact he often vocalizes and puts his little hands in his mouth, grabs objects with my help and brings them into his mouth).\n    Sometimes he seems to get my attention by vocalizing but I don't know if it's a projection on my part. However, it doesn't always do this. The point is that it seems like an intermittent light bulb to me, let me explain better: sometimes there seems to be some reciprocity, other times I notice that his gaze is lost or fixed on some points of the room or on the ceiling.\n    Other than that, I booked:\n    - visit with a geneticist, following the advice of the pediatrician who gave relevance to the signs but not to the issue of eye contact.\n    - neurological visit, he seems jerky and after hospitalization for covid it seems to me that he had some strange jerks and that he lost consciousness. Sometimes I find him with his arms high and his eyes wide open and with an expression of fear.\n    \n    For the rest he is a smiling baby, who cries when he is hungry, is neither hypotonic nor hypertonic and is growing well.\n    I don't deny that I am anxious, has anyone ever had their baby develop eye contact after the 3rd month?\n    \n    Let's say it's the combination of things that worries me (eye contact, club feet, micrognathia and enlarged kidneys). What do you think? \n    \n    Sorry for my poor English but I'm Italian and I don't speak it well.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1fw0z4l\/syndrome_or_early_signs_of_autism_is_early\/","main_id":"1fw0z4l","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-04 14:49:10"}

Apologies for spelling errors ahead of time.\n\n  \nBackstory: This all started at my sons 1-year pediatric visit. His Dr. came into the room and noticed a few things.\n\n1. No stranger danger\n\n2. Opening and closing cabinet door repeatedly\n\n3. Non verbal\n\nHe suggested Pediatric ENT, SLP and Developmental Pediatrician (DP). The ENT and Speech Pathologist dad and I agreed with. The DP came out of left field. My thought was if he had hearing issues, it would make sense for him being non-verbal. The wait time for a DP is over a year long and he stated his referral was more cautionary. He also said that he tends to over index on developmental concerns. Dad and I discussed and decided to continue with ENT and SLP and hold off on DP.\n\nAt ENT, he failed hearing test in both ears and he had a ton of fluid in his ears. We proceed with surgery. He started SLP and has been going for a year now. His SLP feels he is progressing as to be expected. He still has a ways to go but we've seen no regression or stalling in speech. No (new) issues with fine motor skills Ears are fine and he passed his post recent hearing tests.\n\nAt his 2.5 year visit, we tell the Dr. that our sons is a picky eat. \u00a0He has no issues touching foods or different textures. The Dr. says he is less concerned with Autism, but the picky eating still gave him pause. At 2.5 years old, I am thinking it\u2019s \u201ctypical\u201d to have a picky eater. Our son did not demonstrate any of the prior behavior he'd shown at his 1.5 year visit. No closing\/opening cabinet. Does have stranger danger and is more verbal. He did say that because the visits aren't long (15 mins) he could not give a full assessment and the SLP would be able to give better feedback. We chatted with his SLP (she does not diagnosed for Autism,) she does work with patients on the spectrum and she had not seen any behavior to suggest autism. She did say that if we had concerns, moving forward with the DP would be best. Husband and I decide to get put on the waitlist (12 month wait) for DP Eval.\n\n3 year visit, the Medical Assistant\/Dr. comes into the room. Our son looks at both dad and I to see if it was safe to interact with them. After that, he was very cooperative. Our son started spinning around looking at the light. He did this for a few seconds and stopped. This is not his typical behavior. He has an Optometrist apt next week. We think he may have some vision issues. He gets right up to the TV and squints. He engaged with the Dr. giving high fives, waving\/saying \u201cbye\u201d, etc. \u00a0He gave eye contact to both MA\/Dr throughout visit. Everything the Dr. asked him to do, he did. He engaged with the Dr. giving high fives, waving\/saying \u201cbye\u201d, etc. Dr. brings up autism again this time adding ABA and that he could help get an Autism diagnoses quicker. He doesn\u2019t have any behavior issues, self-copes very well, interacts with his peers, things that would suggests he isn\u2019t someone who needs ABA. \u00a0He is very independent and can do the typical daily things (for his age) no problem.\n\nA family member who is an adolescence psychologist with autistic patients visited us recently. He doesn\u2019t diagnose but he said based on his observations, he saw no signs. Our son is verbal, but he isn\u2019t one to chat around strangers. At home, he is constantly singing\/talking, etc. He has playdates with kids his ago no problem.\n\nI am at the point of wanting to either move Dr. and\/or get a second opinion. Again, we will proceed with the DP. \u00a0His pre-school teachers have not mentioned any concerns regarding his development. The Dr. is the only person to question it. \u00a0If our son is on the spectrum, we will accept it and continue to provide him with the needed treatment, but it seems to me that this is being heavily pushed by his Dr. We are doing everything we would be doing if he was on the spectrum. His Dr. has not given consistent feedback over the past year and his prior concerns has been resolved.\n\nThe pushiness is what bothers me most. It seems like he has diagnosed our son. Since his ear surgery and Speech therapy, he has gotten progressively better. He literally went from not talking at all to now saying 3 word phrases. I do not want to be dismissive of his Dr. which is why we are proceeding with DP eval but I need him to give me more other than what he has before I consider other resources like ABA. I do not want to \"throw\" things at my son hoping it sticks. \n\n\u00a0Am I missing something here?

The table in front of me were 6 women, one of them literally looks back at me and gives me the rudest stare while i was trying to calm my son down, she then did it again and said something about my son to her friend and they both looked at me with a nasty look. I got sooo anxious, angry, frustrated i knew she was talking about my son, or thinking that im the \u2018bad mom\u2019 that wont discipline her kid. The same day as i was walking and my son was stimming ( he yells) one lady also gave me a dirty look and closed her ears!! I mean we just walking past u its not like he was screaming non stop near ur head! \nI know sometimes kids can be annoying and loud and we get annoyed, but  please, dont give parents the dirty stare and look of judgement. Do you think we are enjoying this? The mall was crowded it was the weekend if u dont want to hear kids screaming just stay home. I started crying as soon as i got in the car. I myself was frustrated with the way my kid was screaming then i get a dirty stare from people ? \nAnd it really breaks my heart because my son cant express himself verbally yet so when he is frustrated he just cries and yells(like all kids obv) even when something hurts him he just cries and wont tell u what is hurting him so it\u2019s also hard for him\nEven before i was a mother, i never once gave parents a rude stare when their kids are having tantrums because i know that it is already tough on the parents, and they are trying their best to calm their kids down\u2026 \n\nHow do u guys handle stares and judgmental looks from people?

My 6yo is a level 1, possibly 2 according to the diagnosis we received a few months ago. Anxiety has been an issue for them for a long time, mostly over loud noises like crying babies or kids shouting, and always over movies or TV shows that either have or could possibly have a \u201cbad guy.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure how to help. School says that anytime another kid has a meltdown or whines\/cries, my kid exhibits the same behaviors and demands that the other kid stops. Won\u2019t be removed from the situation, put on headphones, go somewhere else or do something else, even when directed to do so or guided away. Always comes back to the situation with the negative stimulus and stands there with hands over ears, demanding that it stop.\n\nAlso terrified of movies and TV shows to the point where even when they watch a PBS Kids show in class as a treat, there are extreme crying meltdowns, almost to the point of a panic attack. Sometimes these are shows or movies we\u2019ve watched at home that cause these extreme reactions. Teachers have tried moving my kid to another adjoining room with a friend, but my kid ends up creeping around the door to peek in at whichever \u201cscary\u201d thing they\u2019re watching.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do with this.

For us, it started last year when she was in kindergarten.  She's always been very shy and never really interacted with kids her own age.  She was two years old when the Pandemic struck and I've worked mostly from home ever since so she never attended day care or preschool prior to kindergarten.  Once she started school she started having accidents (she was mostly potty trained but not completely).  The school set up a student study team to address these issues and other issues she was having.  Her speech can be unintelligible at times and she had a hard time following verbal directions.  At the student study team meeting we consented for her to be tested to see if she qualified for special ed services and an IEP.  After they finished the testing we had her IEP meeting.  \n\nShe qualified based on speech and language.  Academically she is behind her peers and socially she struggles to initiate any interactions.  She usually waits for someone to invite her to play.   Luckily she found about 3 friends that like her and get her to play with them but they have to initiate any interaction.  During the course of the testing they determined that she meets the educational criteria for Autism.   They recommended putting her in a SDC for 66% of the day.  My husband said he didn't want to go any more than 50% due to a bad experience that his son had in SDC.  So now she's in her SDC 50% of the day and mainstreamed the other 50%.  \n\nSince she met the educational criteria for Autsim we decided to see if we could also get a medical diagnosis.  We're now waiting for an appointment with the evaluation center which should be this month.\n\nI was just wondering what signs or symptoms you saw in you child that led to you seeking a diagnosis of Autism?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1fwkgkg\/what_first_led_you_to_seek_a_diagnosis_of_autism\/","main_id":"1fwkgkg","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-05 06:50:02"}

My daughter (5) lost a bottom front tooth and for some reason now she refuses to close her mouth entirely or swallow the saliva in her mouth. She lost the tooth Tuesday night last week. The first night, she refused to lay down, instead insisted on trying to fall asleep while holding herself up (laying on her tummy). Eventually she sat on her butt, fell asleep and fell back into her pillow. She sleeps normally now, mouth closed and all but when she wakes up she immediately holds her mouth open again. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a sensory issue, as we\u2019ve tried all methods to get her to close her mouth and in the times we are able to, she ends up flooding her mouth with saliva and eventually drooling everywhere. She still drinks milk from bottles, and has been refusing her normal rice for dinner instead only wanting yogurt. She doesn\u2019t talk a lot. She can say some things she\u2019s heard before, but she has a good understanding of what we are trying to tell her most times. \n\nShe\u2019s very picky on what she eats, so I think the slight taste of blood from losing a tooth has prevented her from wanting to swallow her saliva.\n\nAny advice is appreciated.

I understand that, but I still think it\u2019s important to be realistic about the fact that training to handle bites and other forms of physical aggression (putting your hands around someone\u2019s neck when frustrated is indeed aggression - the coworker I talked to almost got a bit touchy when I called it aggression\u2026 but it\u2019s aggression.

As she\u2019s pulling the third sticker off (a pink bowtie), it rips, and she rip the whole thing up, and now she wants another one; not a pink bowtie sticker - a whole new *page* of stickers, because she\u2019s ripped the first page up into little bits on the floor.\n\nIt\u2019s at it\u2019s most prominent when she\u2019s tired and cranky, so we\u2019ve learned to avoid intricate, in-depth activities late in the day, but does anyone have any advice on how we can help her develop some tools for managing this tendency?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1fx577i\/extreme_perfectionism\/","main_id":"1fx577i","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-06 01:11:33"}

I communicate with very well and reciprocates very well, but when moments hit the ceiling like tonight i just want to throw the towel down. It was a fair day, but some typicals a couple of tantrums and him pinching and biting his baby brothers arm. Well...thats another story of our daily life! Before bed gave them both a light snack and their milk. He brings me his plate to the sink which i praised he for it while his brother and dad are eating. I nicely said, please go sit down. And a panic of the loudest, nail scratching along the chalkboard,  I mean tempo to level 100% bursting out of his little mouth and...im triggered. The whole neighborhood heard him, i mean the shopping center by our home, and maybe even the next town. And im like.....gobsmacked!!! When he does this i not only get, frustrated internally with him and upset, because of the aftermath it puts our entire family in that moment that he does quite so often. I try to protect and shield what i can possibly collect to avoid the embarrassment. What i hate most about when he does this is, he not oly gets to freaking inconsolably loud, he also scars his 2 year old brother,  frustrates his dad who goes over to ensure our other toddler that everything is ok, but he triggers me to a place i dont like which is firmly take him to another room and knee to look in his eyes and ask him.....what are you screaming?? Nothing i said, makes have to scream like his? Mommy only asked you to sit down and your screaming and shouting so loud you're scaring your brother, and making dad not too happy, and mama upset. Mind you, dont forget that about 3 hours ago he had bit his brother, spitefully when my husband and I were in the kitchen putting dishes and food away after lunch. So yes, there was a little bit of a frustration with him for doing that to his brother. What im saying it just keeps adding up through the day with things like him biting, pinching,  screaming frantically out of no where, meanwhile....it was a fair day where everything else was nice an calm him being bouncy and happy and so were all of us. Im just so confused why things go from laughter and play, to what the h*ll? Im unhappy about him always biting or attempting to bite his 2 year old brother at least 2 to 3 times a day, out of inability to express his frustration with his brother like brother took awayva piece of bacon he was about to eat, or brother bit him 2 days ago and this was souping up for a while in him. So random, he'll just bite him when he knows we're not watching with out backs turned for that nano second and i mean nano second that we hear his brother crying or not crumying because he just got so used him biting him all the time. Tonight like i said, it was fair...but our life is a hectic zoo and we just cant catch that train to calmness at all. When screamed like that i took him to their bedroom and looking his eyes and said, you NEED to stop screaming like his! You are ok, nothing is wrong, but when you scream like this everyone tjings something bad is happening to you and your brother is scared. You keep doing this, what if one day you really need help then people wont believe you because you scream about everything so loud when you are ok. Please stop! Im sure i did everything wrong, :( but I am stressed out! BTW, he is very verbal,  little sensory issues, of course behavioral struggles,  but sharp as a wip (MA) its just these moments that make me clinch my teeth that i need help with!

She is currently in early intervention and we live in Tennessee. She receives speech twice a week.\n\nThe first year of her life, she was watched by grandparents.

They would call us weekly to come get her for not napping and I\u2019ve later found out that they didn\u2019t really work with my daughter, they let her do her own thing instead of helping her follow the group. \n\nWe pulled her from this daycare and she went back to grandparents for a few weeks since we had a spot at an in home daycare.

She let us go in 3 weeks because she wasn\u2019t adjusting well and the lady couldn\u2019t handle mine plus all the others. \n\nI had previously declined services through the school hoping that the in home daycare would work out.

I feel empty and broken. I know that sounds bad but I really have nothing left to give them. I(21f) and my husband(23m) have identical autistic twins (3m) and a baby (1m). They are beautifully, creative and I believe very smart kids. The twins are diagnosed with ADHD, mild to moderate autism spectrum disorder, and a language disorder. They are preverbal (we like to think they will talk one day so we try not to say nonverbal). Everyday gets harder and harder. We have the whole house completely safe. There shouldn\u2019t be a single thing that can happen to them. Yet, everyday something happens. The twins are so aggressive towards each other. They are constantly hurting each other, themselves or me. They seem to have no concept of danger. We had a horrible cooking accident a year ago which ending up with us in the hospital for a week. We are still being seen by an outpatient burn specialist and are scheduling surgery for scar removal for my second born twin. (Before anyone says anything about kitchen safety I was burned also I was so close to him. He was not left alone in the kitchen. Although that does not excuse it and we have since blocked off the whole kitchen). I turn around to make the baby a bottle or I\u2019m changing one of their diapers and everything goes to hell in seconds. Hair pulling, biting, scratching, throwing things, pushing, kicking, screaming. We try disciplining with time outs, taking toys, and talking it out. Nothing seems to work and if either of them get too upset they start rocking, shaking and throwing up. The worst part is the lack of ability to speak. They sign a few things which is very helpful and they seem to understand most of what people say. We are going on three years with no words. I wish so badly I just could have a conversation with them. A back and forth, not a one sided street. I just feel so broken at this point. The screaming never seems to stop. We have gone to extreme lengths to try to solve their issues. We have even sent one twin out of state for a few weeks with family. We were hoping with distance they would stop fighting so badly but it only increased the amount. Also, my oldest (the twin we sent out of state) seems to have separation anxiety now. We are working on that with their psychiatrist. We are on a waiting list for Aba and will start next month. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m holding onto at this point. I know I should be grateful because they aren\u2019t as extreme as some cases. I feel so bad. Almost everyday at three pm I just want to give up and cry. We don\u2019t have much help as they are extremely difficult to handle and accident prone. Almost every time we sent them to family for a night or a few hours they come home badly injured. It\u2019s not lack of supervision on my family\u2019s part they are just incredibly difficult to keep safe. My husband has to work non stop for us and I honestly feel like he\u2019s given up completely. He still plays with them and loves them. But if he will use any excuse to get out of the house without us. I don\u2019t blame him. I think anyone would at this point. We just don\u2019t see a way out. I just miss the feeling of holding them when they were first born. I was so happy. Sorry this is so long.

What do I do?","selftext":"We were on vacation. My daughter, son & step daughter went to take the luggage cart down to the car. (They took it down while I was in the bathroom. I would have gone with them normally). Step daughters wolf stuffie (stuffed animal) was set by her on top of the things on the cart. It fell. Daughter caught it and step daughter lost her mind thinking it was being played with. She pushed my daughter against the wall and started to choke her. Context- step daughter is 11,  4' 11 and 130 lbs. Daughter is 10, 4' and 70 lbs. So my daughter was at a disadvantage to defend herself. My son (12) stepped in and stopped my step daughter from choking further. Step daughter came up and told me what happened right away. I talked to the kids separately to try and get an idea of what had happened. She had not ever told my kids that her wolf stuffie meant that much. She herself has played with it, tossing it around. So, they didn't know it would trigger her by just catching it from falling. I told her dad and he talked to her about it, but also reversed the blame (well daughter should have known to not touch it.) \n\nNothing has been done with her counselor or anything. It's frustrating to me that I'm supposed to just let it go. That my daughter who was choked is supposed to just take the blame for her 11 year old step sister. There's been issues at school with biting her friend in the way and stabbing a kid with a pencil who wouldn't leave her things alone. Things are obviously triggers but it's frustrating that the answer is \"well she is a good kid! She was made to lash out because her stuffie was touched.\" It's like she's never accountable. I want to be able to support her. But I also want everyone to be safe. \n\nShe can verbalize feelings but often won't say or show she's upset so there was no clue she was having a hard morning and would have a meltdown over her stuffie. My oldest (16) is autistic and I myself am so it's not a foreign thing. Just new for supporting step daughter.

Lately Ive seen what seems most likely autistic Level 1 people talk about this and i don't wanna be that kind of guy but i'm actually just tired of this discourse. I know i know, but it feels like nowadays Even the most minimim thing is abusive, and i think that as far as you know your child you won't force him to do this, thats clear. This is just like an example, but i'm meaning in the deeper Level like every-single-thing it's abusive. I'm trying to be on their shoes but i feel like the role as parents is just never seen, even those like is that actually study and take courses and therapy and help, and resources etc etc just to teach them the Best we can based on their condition. It seems like it just kot enough amd all i see is hate and resentment and Even accusations, that while some are on point and i think very valid, some aree just minimal things being criticized and honestly sometimes just get me on my nerves the 0 validation we get after all the Work and effort we do. \n\nThis Is the copy of a comment i Made on the post and i would like yo know your opinion?? Maybe  i'm exagerating or being intolerant???\nAs a co-parent of an autistic child i'm very concerned how nowadays we are the worst everyday for teaching our kids to relationate, and not only on \"social standards\" but also hygiene, physical care, needed sports, discipline, education, etc.  And then some have the nerve to say that if we don't we are negligent and don't see them as real person or as an equal of normal people.\n I know every autistic life is diferent, but also promoting that they isolate, don't interviene into them properly care or education just because they \"don't like it and \"\"\"it's abusive that we make them brush their teeth\"\"\" it's a highly dangerous posture.\n\n It's not about forcing them to look at other people touch them or anything that the post says (if You know your kid your obviously know that You can't snd shouldn't force him just for superficial standard norms like those just so he can socialice, i'm meaning more deeper on their development as ive seen even trying to help them learn that somehow is abusive nowadays???) like how on earth i'm going to let You only eat something that you like that Will 100% make your sentitive stomach hurt and got you ill, and youll suffer more being super overwhelmed and be super sensorially uncomfortable after that, just because if i dont im abusive??\n\nI always feel that in this type of internet portals they often don't include neurodivergences that can derivate into some comorbility,etc etc. People with autism Level 3 also exist. Even on therapy, teachers encourage us to help them navigate skills ln they own terms, obviously trying the Best so it can be with their own autonomy, but they are needed so they can thrive on society on their own some day. Socialization is very important. Education and at least trying to teach them skills so they can survive is also very important. \nIt's not like i'm going to let my kid hurt himself or someone else with stereoripias, just because it reassure his anxiety, or let him me n4ked on public just because he feels comfortable like that and just dont understand social norms. Sometimes they just don't understand the work that at least a bit-educated-on-nerodivergence parents do for their sake and i feel like it's never going to be enough","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/d4qpa2yll5td1.jpeg","main_id":"1fxixrh","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-06 15:22:36"}

My 2.5 year old can say maybe 12 words but does not say them daily. He is not conversational but has good receptive language.

A is well appointed and cared for, turned 18 and can function in society.\n\nH is 15, 16 in a few days. S is 9. We lost our home about a month ago, I lost my job and my wife couldn't maintain us on Uber money. Kids get SSI but that's about it. Because they both get it, we technically \"make to much for services\". Medical card sure, but thats it. H has been under medicated his entire life. I'm at the point where convincing my wife that hospitalization for him is what's best. It's going to have to happen to S, too.\nHere we are, in an AirBnB with none of the things they are accustomed to. I won't talk about the meltdowns, the screaming, \"stupid dad\", all of that. I'm dead to it now.\n\nI won't talk about how they beat the shit out of each other, and H consistently says \"Monster Dad hit eye\" even though I don't wrestle or play with him like that. I won't talk about CPS cases every year because they both self harm, sometimes brutally. I won't talk about the lack of services after the people come. How they close the case and Waiver program help never comes.

Never mind her brother has one. Nevermind her sister has one....\n\nI also won't talk about getting kicked in the throat and watching my dog get the shit beat out of him because My Talking Tom 2 froze.

And it has to taste a certain way like from restaurants or he won\u2019t eat. If it doesn\u2019t taste exactly like it should he won\u2019t eat. If that makes sense. It also has to look the same. Also if I start singing or talking too loud over his food he won\u2019t eat it. If someone else in the home serves his food he won\u2019t eat. It has to be me. I\u2019m currently waiting to get him into therapy.

My older two and myself are \"high functioning\" (\ud83d\ude44) and she seems to be on our end of the spectrum minus some enhanced communication difficulties; always figuring things out (especially how to open things) and what not.\n\nHowever...\n\nlil mama does NOT like men touching me. She's fine with me touching women & women touching me but she has had 2 significant melt downs in relation to men touching me. I'm finishing my bachelor's degree so she's never been at daycare since I do online education, and the only man I am usually ever around with her is her father, except for when we are all at church. \n\nSituation one:\n\nWent to the dr because I was having foot pain. Dr was a guy. We chatted for a while and eventually he asked me to stand up to check my posture. He touched my ankles and when he did that, my lil girl started WAILING! Like, full throttle!!! I was able to soothe her but she'd start crying any time she saw him touch me. Tall white dude in his late 40s, fit, healthy, bet his middle name was Chad.\n\nsituation two:\n\nAt the grocery store the next day or two after the dr appointment. I see this old man walking real funny. We live in a sketchy neighborhood so I didn't know if it was a homeless person rolling on dr ugs or someone trying poorly to steal and stuff something in his shirt. Whatever was happening, the person was struggling. I went over and found out he was just an old man feeling very week and struggling to balance. I helped the man over to a nearby shelf to have something to hold onto and she was fine with that. He looked weak and I didnt want him falling so I asked him to hold onto my arm until a store employee came with a chair. My daughter was fine for a moment until I guess she realized he wasn't going to stop touching me like the dr stopped touching me because she lost it again and cried until the man was able to sit down. Then once the contact stopped, she quit crying. This guy was probably in his 80s, Hispanic, maybe 100 pounds and about 5 ft tall. Very frail. (I parted ways with the old man & we both finished shopping. He ended up falling in the parking lot & thankfully only scraped his arms badly & I stayed with him until an ambulance arrived to take care of him.)\n\nWoman can touch me, I can touch women, but both times with men she did NOT like it... why?

As we were waiting in the childrens department he got too overstimulated as there were lots of children there so I took him outside and waited in the non urgent adult waiting area that consisted of about 5\/6 patients. It was 9:30pm and my child usually sleeps at around 7:30 so it was way past his bedtime and he was tired and not dealing well being that environment. He was sat next to me and singing his ABC\u2019s, he wasn\u2019t loud but he wasn\u2019t quiet either and he doesn\u2019t understand or know how to control his voice levels at all (its something we have been working on but we haven\u2019t overcome yet). Anyways\u2026 Along comes a lady about 65 years of age, she checks in and whilst shes speaking to reception she looks back at me and gave me a horrid dirty look\u2026. Given her age and the fact that we were in hospital I let it slide and ignored her, I asked my son to be quieter but he seriously cannot control it and anyone with autistic children knows that this can be difficult for some kids. Another 10 minutes pass by and out of nowhere the same lady decides to shout at me rather aggressively and says \u201cit\u2019s not appropriate for him to be this loud control him we\u2019re in a hospital\u201d, boy oh boy did she unleash a dragon. I shot up and told her \u201c do you even know why he\u2019s singing a bit loud? He\u2019s autistic so instead of judging and shouting you could be kinder and ask politely, she then proceeds by shouting at me this time and says IM AUTISTIC too now what? I got the feeling that she was lying and said are you really because you just seem rude and she replies how would you know??? Despite the heat of the moment I responded and said \u201cyou know what that was wrong of me to assume you are not, I truly apologise but please try and understand that everyone with autism presents differently.\u201d Do you know what this woman responded by saying? \u201cYeah you better apologise now shut your mouth\u201d. Boy oh boy numero 2 because all I saw was red. I told her you\u2019re a horrible bitter woman with no compassion for others because he is a 5 year old child and whilst you are able to wear noise cancelling headphones should you really need them, he doesn\u2019t understand the concept of noise levels and as an adult you should know better. The receptionist then came out and told us to be quiet and I just took my son and went to the back of the waiting area and my tears just started falling uncontrollably. Its just so tough because whilst I was in the paediatric waiting area so many parents with their sick babies kept giving my son and I looks and look I understand they don\u2019t know him or know that hes got Autism and Adhd so its easy for them to assume that he is not which just sucks sadly but this is life\u2026 The worst thing about all of this is that way before this situation took place, I asked the nurse in charge in paediatrics if they could offer my son a quiet room as it was late and he was not dealing well in the hospital setting, the nurse seemed so bothered by my q\u2019s and said no we can\u2019t, there is nothing we can do. I am going to write up a formal complaint to the hospital because as far as Im aware Autism is a form of disability and why should a hospital not accommodate or even try to accommodate disabilities that aren\u2019t always visible?

He had already been flagged for early intervention at his 2 year check up, but had passed the MCHAT just barely. Our pediatrician was still concerned so put in referrals for speech, OT and a behavioral pediatrician. A few months later we went in and the specialist said it was pretty clear that he was autistic, giving him an ADOS score of 36 which is only 1 point away from moderate to severe. At a later appointment I asked what his level was and his doctor said somewhere around a level 2, *maybe* level 1.\n\n\nWe put him in OT, speech and ABA, and when he aged out of EI, special Ed preschool. In our case the pandemic actually helped as we both were WFH and we scheduled all of our appointments at 8:30 am or on the weekends. When daycare opened back up they allowed us to put his BT in with him, so he could do Sped preschool in the morning, we'd pick him up and take him to daycare where he'd nap and then do ABA with his NT peers around him. It was a lot of work and a lot of driving but we made it work.\n\nThen finally last year at age 5 he graduated from ABA. Then we got off the wait list for school after care so we no longer had to pick him up in the middle of the day to take him to daycare. And the big thing, which j believe helped the most, was that he was finally diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety, so we started trialing meds. It took a while but I think we've finally landed on a combo that works.\n\nLast year we were able to slowly ramp up his gen Ed minutes, and at the end of last year they turned his OT minutes to consult instead of 1:1. This year he's in full gen Ed with only pull outs for reading and speech. His private OT is getting ready to graduate him. A few weeks ago we had a check in with his behavioral pediatrician and I asked again what he thought his level was and he said level 1! We are so proud of all the work he's done!\n\nWe still have our struggles. He still has random meltdowns over stuff but they're few and far between.  He struggles socially, his speech is \"weird\", and he's a total slob. But I feel like we're starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and I'm actually filled with hope for the first time in a while.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1fxso8j\/going_from_level_2_level_1\/","main_id":"1fxso8j","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-06 22:26:17"}

I\u2019ve been working part time in a remote role. I started a full time salary position when I had my son because his father didn\u2019t want to enroll our son into daycare We don\u2019t have relatives to help my mom is elderly and recovering from cancer and my dad passed a couple of years ago my boyfriend just has his dad and he does not help. \nMy son was  diagnosed with autism at 2.He does a lot of jumping off furniture and standing on furniture and has screaming tantrums. He probably has about 50 words but he only talks when he wants to and is very demanding avoidant. I listen to crying all day long. \n\nI watch him from 8:00-4. I work 4-9. I do dishes and I\u2019m also pitching in while I work. I have a phone job. Whatever cleaning I can get done between dishes, preparing meals and snacks, errands, teaching, and trying to potty train. I\u2019ve done all the work toward my son\u2019s diagnosis, speech\/ot therapies. Waitlist for ABA and pre-K enrollment.\n\nHis dad watches my son while I work and usually takes him to the park. He will give him a bath. \n\nWe have also been cosleeping with our son since he was a newborn. His dad thinks he needs to be monitored all night. He doesn\u2019t even need a diaper change anymore. He\u2019s dry most nights. He insist we sleep in different rooms because I snore even though he snores too. \n\nCleaning - he takes out the garbage and mops and cooks occasionally. \n\nWhenever my boyfriend is home he didn\u2019t want to engage with my son. He expects me to do everything. I typically don\u2019t mind staying in while he mows the lawn or runs whatever errands he needs to do. \n\nI often find as soon as I go for a walk or go to a hair appointment. He is topically really angry when I come back and he usually completely ruins my whole day. He will often complain constantly about a-z  things he is unhappy about that I did or didn\u2019t do \n\nI\u2019ve asked nicely if he could not come in the house complaining. I\u2019ve usually had a long day with our son and I just need a minute to breathe before I start work. He  says he doesn\u2019t care and will continue to tell me everything he\u2019s unhappy about and says his favorite line I need to listen because it\u2019s his house. I say I\u2019m not an employee or a child. I don\u2019t want to hear this right now. \n\nThe weekends are usually me making breakfast for everyone. I get my son dressed and ready for the day.  I play with him.  My boyfriend is usually running errands or working on a project and monopolizing the whole weekend for himself. \n\nIf a want to go for a a cup of coffee, catch up with my sister for brunch or go for a walk. You would think the world is about to end if I\u2019m gone for a few hours. He\u2019s has left the house for hours and I have been completely fine. \n\nI\u2019ve had discussions about alternating and splitting the day up but there is never any compromise. He literally thinks we should clean or do house projects every minute of the day. I feel like I\u2019m more than doing my part but I\u2019m in this constant cycle of being gaslit into thinking I\u2019m doing nothing we it\u2019s not the case at all and I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind and walking on eggshells.  While all of this is going on he has been in denial about our son\u2019s diagnosis off and on and resistant into him doing special education pre school or ABA. He just wants him to sit at home.  I would just like him to put a little more effort into everything. \n","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1fxyh7b\/dividing_time\/","main_id":"1fxyh7b","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-07 03:27:44"}

At a loss ","selftext":"Hi all, \n\nI am not a parent, I'm an older sister, I hope I can still post here.\n\nI (25F) am having incredible difficulty with my sister (21F), mainly her cleaning habits around the house. Our parents have both passed away so we live together. She was diagnosed with autism last year along with depression, ADHD and I believe anxiety. I work full time and she is currently unemployed.\n\nShe will not clean up after herself no matter how much I ask or try to offer help, or implement things so she will feel encouraged to do so. I would not care so much if it was only in her space. But she will cook dinner and leave food out until the next morning. She will leave dishes everywhere. Her clothes\/dirty laundry in the bathroom. She will let the cats litter overflow to the point that they can't use it. Its unhealthy and unhygienic. It makes me feel like I am living in filth. It doesn't matter how much I ask. She always says she \"forgot\". She used to be okay with her cleaning habits and would forget here and there, but lately it is becoming debilitating. I can't come home every day after work anymore and clean up after her.\n\nI have tried to hard to be understanding and I don't know how else to offer help or assistance so that she will do these things. I have even said to her you don't need to put dishes in the dishwasher, at least put them in the sink so I can do it. She will also waste and eat my food. I can't afford to keep buying her things either - she receives benefits and is looking for work but I am starting to struggle financially because she hasn't got a job.\n\nMy aunty lives interstate who I have voiced these concerns to and we are both quite close with her, but she seems disinterested or asks me if I've tried speaking to her... which I have multiple times.\n\nI have tried to communicate with her but all I get is one word answers. I offer to help and she says \"yeah\". I ask her to do something and she defensively says \"I forgot\". I am really really trying to not lose patience but I am getting very frustrated. I don't know what it's like to have mental health illnesses and autism I know she has had it difficult, but I can't support her when my own mental health is suffering and I am becoming so stressed at the situation.\n\nShe is in therapy and has been for 1-2 years but I haven't seen a change in behaviour. I offer to take her out when I can, go on walks, and sometimes buy her small things. I have also tried to explain how taking on all of the mental load is affecting me but again she is not receptive and I don't know how to get through to her.\n\nI really need some advice on how to communicate with her so something changes, otherwise my last resort will be to move out. I feel guilty moving out but I'm also nearly ready to. I only stayed home this long to look after her. My own mental health is suffering being in an unclean space constantly and I am exhausted cleaning up after her after work and on weekends. I am truly at a loss.\n\n I also will add I find it difficult to communicate with her but I still think I know her and I love her, she is my sister. And I know she will only be better if she wants to be. She is on medication for her depression\/anxiery.\n\nSorry for the massive post. Any advice is very appreciated.

The most important thing that you need to do as a special needs parent, or family member, is to love them as they are, whether or not you have a good understanding (yet) of your childs particular symptoms. It is called a spectrum after all!\n\n2. Success is success in any form. It\u2019s so important to celebrate all the small victories. That could mean saying their very first word at 3, having a successful communication at 5 using a picture board, where you were able to understand that your child wanted cookies, or using an iPad at 17 to tell you a need. Remember every child is different, and will progress at their own pace. \n\n3. Accept that some things will take longer than others, and that\u2019s ok. Stay strong if other adults ask you why your 5 year old doesn\u2019t speak yet, why they rock, or why they are so sensitive to certain sights\/smells\/textures. Use your knowledge to inform others, so they can seek to understand. \n\n4. Believe with all your heart that there are no failures with our children (or your parenting). I love the saying \u201cYou do the best you can, with the information you have at the time\u201d. If you are bravely pushing ahead in the spirit of love and patience, you will always win. Sometimes there will be a certain thing that our child may never be able to do, and that is NOT a failure, it\u2019s a stepping stone to learning another way, or understanding our childs limits. Of course that doesn\u2019t mean never trying again, but being content with them trying throughout their lives, and if it\u2019s still undoable, thats ok too.\n\n5. Even if you are losing your mind and crying to God to tell you what to do, it\u2019s ok. It WILL pass eventually, and we will be all the better for it. \n\n\ud83e\udde9 Love, Advocate, Be Patient, Choose Kindness.

Now, we have to think of our childrens\u2019 needs and protect their rights. \n\nI\u2019m stuck contingency planning and am left looking at alternative placement. This is the only classroom and the only program in the county available to us. Which means all other options are unilateral placement in private schools, with costly tuition. I am hoping someone can point me in the direction of where I can start researching to understand what our options may be. Please know, I am not litigious at all, so the idea of going to court sounds terrible to me, but I would like to know what options I have, if any, to get the district to pay for and reimburse us for tuition costs GIVEN the very real and reasonable expectation that they will not meet our child\u2019s needs (FAPE, IDEA). We are in North Carolina if that matters or helps.\n\nFor abbreviated context, there is one teacher and one TA assigned to the class. There are several students with \u201csignificant behavioral issues\u201c which often require one-on-one attention from the teacher and TA. They are ovefwhelmed with increasing demands, and when they were contracted, they were expecting half the amount of students. \n\nI have witnessed the stressful and dysfunctional environment when I\u2019m doing late drop off or early pick up. For example, I\u2019ve seen times where there\u2019s one adult helping a child in the restroom, while three or four other students are crying, or having meltdowns, while one is trying to run out of the classroom.\n\nGoing back 1 year, this will be the class\u2019 4th rotation of teachers! Last year there were also 2 teachers (1 + TA), they quit for the same cited reasons, and subs rotated in and out. This year, the teachers were hired under different expectations and half the class size, and they\u2019ve resigned so we\u2019re back to subs.\n\nI do not believe the teachers are at fault, instead, I believe the district has created a toxic, unsupportive, unreasonable, constantly changing and poorly managed environment.  The class has nearly doubled in size since last year without a change in the number of resources, i.e. teachers. They have asked for support, resources, aids, and general help the entire time, and get nowhere.\n\nMeanwhile, parents have reached out to the EC department voicing concerns over the challenges we see. Documented concerns include how the class has doubled in size without a change in resources, and an increase in teacher expectations while behavioral issues facing the classroom. The replies from the district parenthetically say you\u2019re lucky we\u2019re not up to 18 kids, which we could be\u2026\n\nThe teachers have all tirelessly appealed for help, more resources, or even an aid, and are met with passive aggressive resistance and toxic judgment. At least once they were told they had to deal with it and find a way to make it work, or else they needed to go back and get more training. Toxic.\n\nWith the current teachers resigned, we received an email that they are attempting to secure substitutes, ideally long-term subs. We\u2019ve been there and done that last year.  Just a few weeks ago, the school notified parents the evening before that class was canceled the following day because both teachers would be out and there were no substitutes. The same thing happened last year with the rotating door. \n\nSo, while I and most other parents are committed to trying to support the teachers and make the best of the situation, hoping to make this work, it\u2019s with that history and context in mind that it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect more closures, more dysfunction, and repeated regression with students having unmet needs.\n\nThe purpose of this PK program is to help this particular group of students be prepared to enter kindergarten in the General Ed population. All students have IEP\u2019s, some simply require speech therapy, and some are autistic with low support needs receiving OT, etc. \n\nAll young children need routine, normalcy, consistent relationships and educational settings, environments, teaching styles and classroom expectations, etc\u2026 maybe even ESPECIALLY children with developmental disabilities and autism. \n\nI CANNOT reasonably expect things to change and something miraculous to happen this time around\u2026 I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible our students\u2019 needs and rights will be met. We are set up dysfunction, failure, regression, and emotional disturbance with constant turnover. Considering this does not seem to be the result of teachers\u2019 failures or shortcomings, rather a history of needs, support, and resources provided by the district to the teachers, do we have any options?\n\nDo these conditions and this history give us the grounds to assertively and respectfully request unilateral placement with financial reimbursement?\n\n I\u2019ve spent hours and hours trying to educate myself on the rights and laws, via Leg websites, Wright's Law, etc., but I\u2019m sure even those in law will agree these are often grey areas. Is it pointless to expect financial help since we\u2019ll probably have to go private? \n\nWhat rights do our children have? \n\nPlease, kind and supportive answers only. Note: this is not about wanting to make noise, be litigious, getting something for nothing, or anything else like that\u2026 Instead, it\u2019s simply about correcting the wrongs and what was avoidable around unmeet needs for our childrens\u2019 education? Thank you.\n\nCROSSPOSTED, I\u2019m sorry wouldn\u2019t let me share to community\u2026","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1fyjllb\/advice_want_district_to_cover_private_placement\/","main_id":"1fyjllb","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-07 21:45:34"}

My almost 6yo daughter is autistic. I have no contact with the parent that raised me but I do know that I was a \u201clate walker & late talker\u201d but that\u2019s all I know. Lately I\u2019m starting to wonder if I am also autistic & if I should do anything about that? I will list a few things about myself. \n- I can\u2019t deal with eye contact, with anyone, at any time. It\u2019s painful, uncomfortable, I don\u2019t even make eye contact hardly ever with my husband. Could be the complex PTSD from having an abusive mother, or could be part of a laundry list of reasons to suspect autism.\n- I don\u2019t like to be touched unless I initiate it, although I love snuggling with my daughter anytime. Non family better stay away\u274c\n- I struggle with simple things like showering & brushing my teeth everyday, I know it\u2019s gross, but it feels overwhelming most days. \n- I struggle with remembering to eat, I usually have 1 meal per day & I eat the same things pretty much all the time. I always suggest the same takeout, I get obsessed with certain foods (right now it\u2019s Talenti Peanut Butter Cup Gelato, I have 1 container every night) \n- I eat the foods I love everyday until quality control fails me & it tastes awful for some reason & I stop eating it & move on to something else for awhile. \n- I really struggle with daily tasks & feel like I only have energy to do one thing per day, if that makes sense. Even if it\u2019s a phone call I have to make. Very, very disorganized & procrastinate everything unfortunately.\n- I find driving really difficult & no matter how well rested I am, after about 15 minutes my eyes start to cross & feel heavy & I feel like I want so badly to fall asleep. It\u2019s hard!\n- I have no friends & don\u2019t know how to make them at my age. I find myself saying THE most awkward things to my coworkers & I die of inner embarrassment as soon as the words leave my mouth. I know that they think I\u2019m weird even though I physically present as \u201cnormal\u201d to them. \n- I have a skin picking & hair pulling disorder, also other variations of OCD\n- I have huge amounts of anxiety about things I could spend all day listing\n- I hyperfixate on sounds that others can\u2019t hear, for example maybe I heard a bug crawling around, or a sizzle coming from the A\/C. \n- I hate loud noises, obnoxious noises, like at my job when everyone is clapping for a birthday song (restaurant) it makes me blink hard & I want to cover my ears.

It's a long read but I'm desperate to help him. \n\nSo multiple psychiatrists agreed that my (17F) autistic brother's (11M) addiction to constant content and gaming is slowly ruining his cognitive ability which could contribute to him being so behind his peers in school. He already has a lower than average IQ (no i didn't make him do an online test, this was a proper assessment) and we thought that's just something completely out of his hand. But we were told that although his brain was physically underdeveloped at birth, we could have improved it tenfold by enforcing positive habits, giving him more support in schoolwork, and eliminating his obvious dependency on constant stimulation through videos and games.\n\nNow my parents are even more aware of this issue than me, but for some reason they just refuse to do anything about it? I'm constantly in arguments and frustratingly long debates with them about his excessive use of the TV, laptop and PlayStation and his lack of agility and physical health. Now don't get me wrong I'm not saying \"ban all gaming and make him insecure about his body\" because to be honest I've played more video games in my life than he has. But the problem is that he doesn't stop gaming, watching gaming videos, talking about games, pretending he's in a game when he's off the PlayStation, even dreaming about them almost all the time. While all his friends go outdoors to play sports and hang out, he sees his after school sports lessons as chores and gives the absolute bare minimum to get through the lesson. We've tried every sport, every hobby, even asked him what he wants and got it for him, but he always gets bored within the first 30 minutes (if that) and tries to leave because he apparently expects everything to be as stimulating and engaging as video games. I love my brother and seeing him pant when running around with people his age give me a mix of feelings of shame that I let him reach that point, hopelessness because he won't cooperate and worry for when he gets to the cruel world of highschool. His diet is also just terrible. He eats a huge bowl of cereal every morning. Like, imagine the biggest portion of cereal you can eat and triple that amount. And that's his default portion every single meal. My parents' choice of grocery items don't help either and he always eats when he's not gaming or on the TV. \n\nI've asked, even literally begged, my parents to stop him from gaming, to buy healthy snacks and to help me find him a good hobby to occupy him other than gaming. They know they're supposed to do all these things but are kind of just prioritising other things. They never want to go through with any plan I set or any of my suggestions, even though they seem to completely agree with them. They just don't think it's \"as big of an issue as u make it seem,\" but they reluctantly agreed to allowing him access to Internet only an hour a day after almost 2 years of me nagging. And honestly, although i thought this is a huge step, it just kept getting worse. He'd get withdrawal symptoms all day and constantly look at the time to see how long he has to wait. He often runs around the house with a toy gun and pretends to be in an fps game, and when he's bored of that he just sleeps or eats through the boredom. I've given him countless books, both informative about topics he likes and entertainment books. I've gotten him indoors archery equipment. A skateboard and Rollerblades. Soccer ball and net. Basketball and basket. Footy ball. Darts. Too much paint supplies to count. Puzzles. Robotics kits. DIY projects. Skipping ropes. A whole tennis table with balls and rackets. All the kits you can imagine. Bought these when i literally worked with minimum salary because I didn't wanna bug my parents about it, and it hurts to always work hard to buy him something and be excited to give him a new hobby then a week later seeing the supplies collecting dust in a pile in the garden. I always thought the new thing would work, i was always wrong. He just refuses to do anything for more than half an hour or a day if you're extremely lucky and the new toy is really exciting. And afterwards he just sees it as a chore if I keep bugging him to do it and either refuses to do it or puts the minimum amount of effort required. Then goes back to sleeping or eating, waiting impatiently for his precious Internet time. It's gotten to the point where he'd get depressive symptoms and a bad temper all day until he gets that hour of gaming and content.\n\nAnd when my parents heard this, they gave him more Internet access instead of addressing the problem. I have no power over my parents' decisions and all I can do is watch my brother's speech problems never improve as he ages. He still talks like he did when he was 6. All I can do is watch him sit alone in school because he can't play sports as good as the other kids. All I can do is ultimately watch him suffer because neither he nor my parents want to cooperate. \n\nP.s. my parents are amazing parents. They just weren't educated about the issues of the Internet and addiction and gave me and my siblings phones for as long as I can remember. They both work full time very hard jobs to provide for us and I can't thank them enough. I've had to fight my own addiction as a kid and I was lucky to recognise it. The only way he will do the same without parents help is if he's willing to, which he isn't. \n\nEdit: thank you for your responses! I've noticed that people think I'm trying to \"get rid of his autism\" or \"fix him,\" but my insistence on minimising screen time and adding more physical activity is because his psychiatrists unanimously agreed that these steps would help him develop his linguistic ability and cognitive function. I didn't decide on my own that they're making the problem worse, I'm going purely based on professional opinion. Not trying to \"fix\" him but rather help him improve.

Every day. \nMy husband wants me to get a FT job (we are comfortable atm, so it's not urgent). I feel that nothing will be taken care of if I do.

We've also tried giving him smoothies with blue berries, bananas, and beets. \n\n\n\nSince he is nonspeaking, we cannot ask him how he is feeling, and we cannot teach him how to use sign language so we are stuck trying to look at his behavior to give us clues.

Returning back to school doing hybrid in-class sessions (limited students in each class, half day, just sitting on chrome books with aids assisting for assignments) for the first half of 1st grade. Then, transferring to another school for full days (\u201cback to normal\u201d) for the 2nd half of 1st grade. It was here that he began having behavioral issues - extreme frustration, meltdowns, and eventually flipping desks, ripping paper, and trashing classroom to get sent home. Teacher and principal were not supportive and labeled him as the \u201cbad kid\u201d in class. I knew something was off, fought hard for months to advocate and get support. Finally had to bring in a Student Advocate to push for IEP and assessments with the district psychologist. Ended up with them determining he is high functioning autistic, adhd and dyslexic. Great, makes sense now! Transferred him to a different school for their SPED program and he completed 2nd and 3rd grade there - great teacher, paraprofessionals, principal, speech therapist and more! I was encouraged to look into guided homeschooling because the team had a hard time keeping up with him academically so he would get bored and frustrated - I was called to monitor and assist with him transitioning between classes and activities because of meltdowns reacting to other kids etc. The school SPED team informed me that they are being instructed to focus on behavioral issues rather than academics, they were concerned that my son was struggling with reactivity which distracted him from academics. \n\nCurrent Situation: I opted to homeschool with an online program with his IEP, speech therapy and more for 4th and now 5th grade. All is going great, he is now reading at grade level (which has been a struggle with the mixed-dyslexia), academically being challenged in a calmer environment and many more benefits.\n\nWe reside in a pretty small desert city in California, and resources are quite limited out here for support. His speech therapy, SPED teacher and case manager are online and it\u2019s made a huge positive difference. He definitely is autistic, and definitely high functioning BUT we don\u2019t have an official diagnosis through medical means.\nWe have support with IEP through school but otherwise no diagnosis. I\u2019m debating on going through the process for this, the old school part of me is concerned about the stigma with a medical diagnosis. There isn\u2019t much support locally so we would be driving 2+ hours out of town for any therapy outside of his schooling.\nI\u2019m worried I\u2019m not \u201cdoing enough\u201d for him, but friends working in SPED are reassuring that I\u2019m doing great. Since he is high functioning and he appears to only need support academically, is it okay to hold off on a medical diagnosis? \n\nI incorporate emotional regulation, some ABA therapy practices, social etiquette, and more with educating myself for him. He seems great now that he\u2019s out of the physical classroom, and he\u2019s super happy with our routine. \n\nAm I doing harm by not medically diagnosing him?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1fz965j\/to_diagnose_or_not_to_diagnose\/","main_id":"1fz965j","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-08 20:04:15"}

","selftext":"Ok, here is the situation: \n\nMy son started attending ECEAP preschool last fall before he was diagnosed. We were upfront with the school and teachers about our concerns for him. Everything went well. We did here about various behaviors but just normal toddler stuff.\n\nThen at the end of the school year his main teacher left and everything started changing. Out of the blue, we started getting talked to about how bad his behavior is by the supervising teacher that trains all the other teachers. She even said that she didn't think he would be able to attend school the following year in the older class with a 2:16 ratio. \n\nAt the time, we were already in the process off getting him diagnosed and set up with a ISP so all we could do was wait it out and hope for the best. \n\nHe attended summer and everything seemed okay and we even saw huge improvements in his behavior at home. Then the new year started. The first thing his new teacher did when she met him was try to force him to make eye contact with her which he seemed very uncomfortable with. Since then all we hear each day is that he is screaming (not upset just loud), doesn't want to come in from recess, and doesn't want to lay down on his cot at naptime. All pretty standard right? But we haven't heard a single positive thing about him from the teachers. I understand that the teachers may be overwhelmed and he needs a little extra attention but isn't that also their job? Why does it seem like they have never worked with an autistic child before? \n\nToday was a breaking point because I observed my child be aggressively shoved over by another child for no reason and almost hit his head. A teacher observed everything and didn't say anything to the other child. We have noticed this before too. Why is our child's behavior a problem but other kids don't seem to get in trouble for far worse? \n\nI don't know what to do at this point. He is a month away from the IEP being finalized and getting the extra support he needs. I really just want to pull him out of school though because I don't feel like he is being treated fairly and it doesn't seem like the teachers want him there. \n\nWhat are my rights at this point?

I\u2019m needing advice on something only you all would understand.\nMy son is 4 with level 2 autism. He recently started public school 2 months ago where he is in a special needs classroom. He is provided with breakfast and lunch at school everyday but he has never eaten it. I send him his own breakfast and lunch everyday as well because I know he is a very picky eater and probably won\u2019t try the school food. Which brings me to the thing I need advice on:\n\nWhen I say he\u2019s a picky eater, I mean there are only a few foods he eats on rotation and he will never try anything outside of that unless it\u2019s a sweet snack. And the foods he eats are pizza, fries, tomato soup, egg bites (won\u2019t eat egg any other way), waffles and pancakes. I\u2019ve always been concerned with the lack of protein in his diet. I\u2019m considering buying protein powder and putting it in his milk next month (because I already spent my grocery budget for the month) The egg bites he only tried a few months ago, so I know it\u2019s possible to get him to try new foods, but most of the time he will gag, or immediately say no to the food. A lot of his food aversions have a lot to do with the texture. He doesn\u2019t like the texture of any meat, and he doesn\u2019t like creamy textures like frosting. We were referred to a dietician but we can\u2019t afford it right now. I have a daughter who eats the same thing me and my husband eat every day, so I\u2019m usually cooking something different just for him which I absolutely don\u2019t mind. I just want him to eat something different and improve his diet.\n\nAll this context to say that I\u2019m starting to get embarrassed of sending the same foods all the time because I know it\u2019s not the best for him. Today I\u2019m sending him pizza for the second time this week, because I sent soup yesterday and he didn\u2019t want to eat it. \n\nIf anyone has a child who is similar to mine in the context of food and diet, I would really appreciate any advice you have.

He also got a person that is supposed to help him with the social part in kindergarten, and to focus during dressing\/ undressing for inside \/ outside play. \nBut we're left with questions no one can answer. \n\nHe  struggle some with the social part(playing \/ interaction) , but I'm actually not that worried about that as he have a couple of consistent play buddies there. I'm more worried that during kindergarten groups, or playing outside, he does not like to be looked at by other children that he normally does not play with. Sometimes it might be okay but other times, all of a sudden he can shout that they are looking at him, and if he is not calmed down within 30 ish seconds, he will start to gag and then puke due to the intense crying. \n\nThis is worrying as this has happened since he was between two-three and no one can guide us.\n\nMy worry is the hard reaction he is having, I'm kind of worried and panicking as to how I can help him through this when no amount of Google, or hospital seem to be able to guide us. \n\nKindergarten is clueless, and multiple conversations with our son and he can't put words as to what he feels when he get looked at, and then he losses interest \/ focus. Might also add that he is a really good speaker so it's not a verbal challenge. He just can't \/ or won't put words on the feelings. \n\nWhen we are out and about in a mall, he might say oh there looking at me, but the calms down within a second. I just wished that would happen all the time. \nHe is also full of feelings and cares for others. If he had a tantrum at home, for example if the pants is hard to get on, I will just remind him to stop, breath and think. That works really well and he mostly calms down so we can discuss what he felt and why. \n\nI could write about 2000 word more to describe our guy but I also don't want to take up to much of your time. Please ask if clarification is needed. \n\nHas anyone ever been in a situation where a child does not like to be seen? \nAny advice and tools to handle this? \n\nApologies if my writing skills are not good, but hoping the message\/ question is clear.

","selftext":"So my kid (9) got his first suspension of the year yesterday. The principle did it instead of the assistant principal or the Dean which is not normal at my kids school. Anyway he phrased it as more of a break. My son has been having anger issues and throwing things. He broke a school computer, he threw his headphones at a kid. Shoved a book across the desks at a couple of girls. Ended up most of the day yesterday in the 4th grade counselors room and the principals office. The principal felt a break was needed. \n\nFall break starts Friday. He always does worse around breaks. 3 of his 4 suspensions have now come close to breaks. His first one was near the end of the year (did not envolvente his anger issues). His next one was around winter break the next year when he kicked his teacher during a meltdown when she was trying to be proactive and stop it before it started.) the next one was after break and he threw a stool and hit a kid (the kid just happened to be in the trajectory of the thrown stool)  And now this one two days before fall break to give him a break before his anger gets the best of him and he hurts a kid.) \n\nMy son is also open enrolled in his school meaning he can only miss like 5% of days unexcused. A sick day doesn't count without a doctors note saying he has flu or COVID. So I can't just call him in sick. Suspensions can count depending on how the administration feels. \n\nOk so that's the information that I can think of that's important. \n\nNow for the question on IEP accommodations (we had his IEP meeting two weeks ago) would it be reasonable to ask for extra days off when we (his team, it would be his teacher, his father and I , and the school SpED and school social worker) decide he needs a break. I wouldn't even mind if he's home doing his school work. He does it well at home. School really is for the socialization for him and his school has been amazing. I just don't know if this is reasonable. But I feel like a couple days here and there for him to reset might help. I also realize it may not help at all. But we need to figure this out before a kid gets hurt. We are working on his anger issues but if we can reset his brain once a month or so with a social break (cause again I would have him do his school work at home). \n\nTl;Dr would it be unreasonable to ask for extra days off in my sons IEP for when he needs mental breaks\/emotional resets.

Just wanted to share my rant from social media today in case any of you can relate or commiserate!\n---\u2010---------------\u2010-------------------------------------------------\n\n\"It's heartbreaking when a child loses friends because of issues related to neurodivergence. They can feel defeated, not worthy or less than.\n\nAnd the truth of the matter is they have a deficit in the brain that makes it virtually impossible to recognize social signals that other people take for granted.\n\nImagine driving through a big city, and EVERYONE can see the traffic lights except you...\n\nHOW terrifying and frustrating would that be?\n\nYou'd never know when you could move forward, when to proceed with caution, or when to stop. Worse, you could cause an accident, hurting you or someone you care about.\n\nNow imagine your friends get angry at you for not seeing these signals...despite the fact you have a disability and can't see them... and decide they don't want to be your friend anymore.\n\nThey could have told you that you were turning left on the wrong light.\n\nThey could have told you the light was red and you needed to stop for oncoming traffic.\n\nBut they just figured you somehow knew  the light was red even though you've tried to tell them time and time again you can't. see. the. signals.\n\nAnd this process happens over and over despite taking countless social skills classes. \n\nDespite trying to constantly check in with friends and parents of friends. \n\nDespite countless debriefs of social interactions to figure out how to do better.\n\nHow to BE better.\n\nWell you know what??\n\nMy kid doesn't need to be better. My kid needs people in her life that will communicate and care enough about her to realize she has a disability.\n\nMy kid is as kind and caring as they come and if she says inappropriate things sometimes, or maybe doesn't respect personal space, it's not because she's a bad kid, she has a disability.\n\nSorry about the rant. My heart is breaking seeing not only my kid but millions of other kids with neurodivergence suffer in silence. \n\nAutism, ADHD, etc are invisible disabilities...not behavioural choices. \n\nDon't treat our kids like there's something wrong with them when it's not their fault. \n\nAnd if you do notice something they do that falls outside of societal norms... tell them about it. (kindly and constructively) \n\nThey'll listen because they so desperately want to fit in and maintain friendships.\n\nThis is the plea from a broken-hearted autism mom to all other moms out there. You can make such a difference in my child's life by having this discussion with your neurotypical child.\n\nThanks for listening...and to my friends...I have a favour...please share this message far and wide.\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1g01eie\/social_cues_and_traffic_lights\/","main_id":"1g01eie","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-09 20:33:29"}

Idk what\u2019s developmentally on track, what\u2019s quirky, and what may be signs of HF ASD. Can\u2019t get in to see pediatrician for 3 year appointment until December. Son is 2y9m old, and here are some of the things I\u2019ve noticed:\n\n- [ ] Echolalia- normal? When is it excessive? He IS intelligent so is he just remembering things he likes? Usually uses them in correct context, but a lot of things he says are verbatim from Bluey or Ms Rachel. Or a whole phrase he\u2019s heard us say before. Can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s true echolalia or just normal toddler language stuff\n- [ ] Gestalt language? \u201cmama, light and dark are opposites!\u201d Has always seemed ahead of the curve with language and vocab and starting speaking 4+ word sentences at ~2years old but maybe it was gestalt learning?\n- [ ] Will try to copy things he sees us doing like cooking and vacuuming\n- [ ] Will point to things and get our attention, brings us things, asks us to play with him, looks when we point, etc.\n- [ ] Sometimes walks on toes but will correct if I say something\n- [ ] Pretty good eye contact if he\u2019s not distracted or feels like he\u2019s in trouble\n- [ ] Likes other kids and enjoys playing with friends, but MDO says he prefers to play by himself. Has several good friends that he\u2019s always excited to see and seems to play really well with- not just parallel play. Likes to copy other kids and be silly. However is pretty bad about sharing and taking turns, and accepting when the playmate doesn\u2019t want to do what he wants to do \n- [ ] Used to line up toys (animals) but in no particular order \n- [ ] Mixes up pronouns (Mama carry you instead of Mama carry me!)\n- [ ] when he gets really really excited, he\u2019ll sort of stomp his feet\/jump\/squeal. Maybe mild hand flapping? But only if really happy and not all the time.\n- [ ] Asks the same things\/says the same things over and over and over again (Mama, what is that? Mama what is that?) no matter how many times we answer\n- [ ] Teachers constantly telling me he \u201cdoesn\u2019t follow directions\u201d or \u201clisten when they tell him rules\u201d. He\u2019s not even 3\u2026is that expected of him all the time or are they being a little harsh?\n- [ ] Had a biting streak at school that got him suspended for a week. Always over sharing toys, with no ramp up. Just bites suddenly, but then shows remorse and says sorry.\n- [ ] Loves to be spun around by his arms or legs, loves to be upside and jump\/bounce\/be thrown onto the bed\n- [ ] Sort of picky with food, but to be fair we should be better with pushing variety. Eats lots of veggies and fruits and minimal amounts of things like crackers or bars, but seems to reject things like pasta, mashed potatoes, Mac n cheese, etc. (but had no problem trying and loving banana pudding).\n- [ ] VERY picky about shoes. The wrong shoes will start a huge meltdown. Takes forever to get used to.\n- [ ] Constantly has things in his mouth- hands, shirt, toys, etc. Constantly trying to eat things like grass and leaves and sticks. Licks things he shouldn\u2019t lick.\n- [ ] Sort of starting to play pretend (\u201cMama I\u2019m a cow! Moooooo!\u201d When eating grass), but not sure when this is supposed to start developmentally\n- [ ] Happy to be social and say hello\/how are you to strangers, doesn\u2019t seem to be shy especially if with a parent\n- [ ] Just seems quirky and odd sometimes. Seems like he has ASD tendencies but doesn\u2019t *quite* fit the bill from what I know of ASD. If he does have ASD, it seems to be HF.\n\n\nSorry for the long post, and I know these are posted all the time but it\u2019s confusing. I feel like he\u2019s likely mild ASD, but I\u2019ve always been anxious about his health so I feel like I can\u2019t trust myself. My husband isn\u2019t concerned at all but he never is (plus I work in healthcare so I have a bit more knowledge than he does). I\u2019ll ask my pediatrician for a referral anyway just to go ahead and get in line, but wanted to see if these signs point to ASD\/SPD when clumped together in the big picture.

I have been in his life since he was 4, and when I first came around we ended up making some changes that were helpful, mostly because I have lots of autistic family, and i didnt buy into his mom saying he \"cant\" do certain things. His mom says he just \u201cwon\u2019t take vitamins\u201d but we have him every summer and weekends, and I would just get the powder ones for his drinks.

He did fight us on it, but now he eats a bunch of different things as we just kept introducing new things. The preface of this is I think he has encopresis but she keeps saying nothing is wrong. Part is diet I think, as he is allowed lots of junk food and sweets at his moms. He only poops in his room, in a pull-up, lying down. And it reeks terribly, and I have only seen him have a formed poop maybe 3 times. He also digs as soon as he starts pooping.

I have just been diagnosed ADHD (Innatentive) after I realised a lot of my kids behaviors in myself, and although not diagnosed my husband has ASD, my therapist who has met us both and did my testing for ADHD is certain that my husband is at least level 1, but since testing is not going to help him in anyway we are fine to leave him undiagnosed, he had pretty much taken his neurodivergence and turned it into his superpower.\n\nOur entire family is quite loud, we get excited easy when talking and most people would say we are shouting alot of the time. But my daughter M gets far too loud, and is annoying to the whole family, especially A. They spend a lot of their spare time gaming on Roblox with their friends often on call. So of course I expect a certain level of noise from several pre-teen girls all on a call together, but M gets very loud, yelling and listening to music really loudly. She is like me and likes to have an extra 'noise' source when she plays games, I nearly always have a youtube video playing in the background although I often just have an earbud in so I don't annoy  other people. So although my kids are in earshot, they are in a different room but I can hear them and check up on them regularly, hell I am often playing the same game as them in Roblox, because apparently playing with mum isn't uncool yet.\n\nIs there a trick or way to help M not get too loud? I get she is excited and the stimulation from the game is probably just pushing her higher, but it seems unfair to cut them both off from playing with their friends just because one is too loud. I have tried going into the room with them, getting thier attention, I get M to look at me when I speak to her to make sure she is listening to me, and can get them to quiet down, but its only for maybe 2 - 5 minutes and she is right back to the same level of loud.

Because of this, teachers have always held him to a high standard of behavior despite signs that he had a disability that made school a struggle. \n\nHe is generally an upbeat boy and has a happy disposition. But he can switch on a dime into a very scary version of himself that we do not understand. \n\nHis first real signs of aggression were towards his little sister when she was just a baby. When he was mad or even just dysregulated, he would knock her over or charge at her. One time we left him alone with her in the car for 30 seconds to grab something and he had reached over and scratched her face so that it bled. He showed remorse about it only after he saw his parents crying and wanted them us to feel better. \n\nShortly after this, about 6 months ago, this aggression started showing up a pre-K. It started as isolated incidents of getting a bit handsy, a level of rough and tumble that his teacher said was pretty common in his integrated classroom. He then started to get highly impulsive and always knocking things over, grabbing things from kids and adults, etc. Then things started escalating to hitting kids harder and then pulling kids\u2019 and teacher\u2019s hair so hard it took multiple adults to get him to let go. He had to be removed from school after a long episode where he hurt several children and teachers. The school had no idea what to do with him and we pulled him from school for the last two weeks. \n\nAfter those incidents, we were advised to take him to an urgent psychiatric care clinic. They set up some consultations that were not helpful in the end because no one could prescribe anything and the waitlist was 6 months long for a psychiatrist. \n\nHis pediatrician prescribed Guanfacine to help with impulsivity and it initially seemed to help. We poured all our time and energy into therapies. He had been in speech for articulation and OT since age 3, so we added talk therapy, a social skills group, and neurofeedback sessions.  \n\nThings got better enough that we were not feeling like we were always in crisis mode. Until right before school was about to start and his behaviors ramped up. Huge meltdowns that would never end throwing and breaking things. We attributed it to anxiety and stress around school starting again. Once he did start, he started great there, but was still constantly melting down at home. Then about two weeks, he had a horrible episode in which he attacked multiple kids and teachers and was told not to come back the following day. \n\nAround this time, we finally were able to have him seen by a psychiatrist and she prescribed a generic form of Ritalin. \n\nHe immediately seemed more in control of his body. He was calm and focused, though mord rigid and prone to loud verbal objections when interrupted during his pretend play games (\u201cGo away!!!\u201d). \n\nThe transformation during the day has been incredible. And he\u2019s been doing great at school with a new plan that includes an aide sticking with him through the day (a special ed advocate helped us convince the school this was best for him rather than total isolation). \n\nBUT he has randomly attacked his 18 month old sister at night close to bedtime 3 nights in a row. Two times it was triggered by her getting in his space, but once it seemed totally unprovoked. And then when you try to get him away, he keeps saying \u201cI need to hurt her!\u201d and having to be held back with all our strength. \n\nIt happened again tonight and I hit a breaking point, just screamed as loud as I could.

I'm a mom with two girls who are Autistic. I have a 10 yr old and a 8 yr old. They both have outside social skills groups in a therapy center weekly, and OT in home once a week, after school program and the youngest has a SLP that is in home once a week as well. \n\nSo my 10 yr old does SO much complaining. No amount of options I give her is good enough. Tonight for example she was looking for a snack, everything wasn't good enough. She spent 20 minutes complaining to herself in the kitchen. I'm at the point where I don't even engage by responding to her. It's not the solution but I am at my wits end. I can suggest everything possible and she just says no to it all. This is the same when it comes to activities, she says she's bored and I offer different things for her to do and she just says no to everything. The only thing she would be okay with is going shopping to get something new. So she is searching for the dopamine in getting a new item because she will get it and it'll be okay for today. But tomorrow she will be back to being bored. With food she has a specific thing in mind and if it's not here then it's 10 times worse because she will complain and complain and whine about it and there's nothing I can do at the moment for her. \n\nI also struggle with my own mental health issues which I'm still working through and I am mentally exhausted in dealing with her and her attitude everyday. I am trying to learn to not engage and it takes a lot of mental capacity for me to do that but her dad battles with her back and forth and I tried to tell him not to because it's not going to do anything and it's not really helping her but at the same time I don't know what to do either. I really don't think ignoring her during that time is helping but I cannot deal with it. \n\nHer sister is way more relaxed and flexible so if there's only one of something she will give it up for her sister and she is more willing to accept options if we don't have what she wants, but that is not the case with the oldest. There has been many many times where she cannot decide or we don't have what it is. She has in her head that she wants and she will stop and whine and basically go to a room slam her door and it will take her over an hour to calm down enough to come out and then she's right back to normal again. It's very frustrating on my part because I am the main caregiver. Her dad and I do live together but he works nights so he doesn't have to deal with these behaviors most of the time. \n\nI don't really have family that truly understand what I go through everyday. My mom spends time with my kids when she can but she lives quite a bit away and my sister lives close and she is basically my kids favorite person in the entire world. It's all about auntie and that's okay but she does not get to see the bad times and that is isolating for me because I don't really have anybody that gets it so it's hard for me to vent to her because she really truly doesn't understand because she gets their good behavior. And yes they have had their meltdowns before when she's taking care of them but obviously she's not dealing with it multiple times a day, multiple times a week, etc. \n\nI literally just go day to day trying to survive my own mind. I have anxiety over everything and it's pretty significant and I'm on medication for it and I am just waking up and getting through to the end of the day and continuing the next day. I am a zombie at this point. It's something that I know I can't continue to do, but I'm also at a loss at what to do to help us.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1g0850m\/10_year_old_complaining_about_everything\/","main_id":"1g0850m","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-10 01:52:40"}

Yesterday I (39f) returned home with my daughter (10f, autistic, speech delay) from the store. We live in an apartment complex so when we pulled up I pulled up the same time as my other neighbor. This neighbor does not speak me anymore. Few months ago I was having an anxiety episode where I saw this neighbor and I didn\u2019t speak because my autistic daughter was with me and it seems like he gets annoyed when he sees her. She likes to say hello to his daughter but he always gives off an energy like he doesn\u2019t want my daughter near his. One time my daughter say his daughter and said hi to but couldn\u2019t get her name right maybe because of speech and language delay. This seem to irritate the dad. I told daughter calmly let\u2019s go because she also doesn\u2019t have spatial awareness and got really close in the little girl face to say hello. I said give a little space to my daughter. Another day I saw the neighbor and I didn\u2019t speak I just wanted to get in the house fast so I didn\u2019t make him uncomfortable. Since I didn\u2019t speak or say hello that one day the energy has been weird. As it should be it was my fault and I should have waved or said a quick hello. But I didn\u2019t that day.

Daughter #1 had a soft marker of an echogenic foci on her heart, which studies also say show slight risk\/correlation to ASD.\n\nSo now worries are now getting seemingly getting confirmed. My ND child #1 had a soft marker; NT child #2 had no soft markers; and child #3 has a soft marker and will have very close birth spacing. \n\nSo my question is this: Did any of you have soft markers during pregnancy?

It's pretty extensive IEP, with about 60% of his time spent in a general education classroom and 40% spent in the resource room, speech therapy, and occupational therapy. When he is in general ed, about half of that time he has an aid to help him. His IEP is written down to the minute, nothing should be left to interpretation. \n\nWhenever I have asked about a specific time my son should have his general education aid, he hasn't. I asked multiple people multiple times that his daily schedule be noted if he doesn't have his aid when he should and I was brushed off. 'Oh, we have a protocol for that, we will handle it,'. Finally, I asked his general education teacher enough that she started making notations on his daily schedule that is sent home and he is getting less than half of his time with the aid. When the aid is not there, he is in the general education classroom with 23 other kids and just the general education teacher. If he is struggling, he can go to the resource room. I emailed the resource teacher, who is the teacher that is in charge of writing and executing his IEP, and she lied and said he is getting all of his aid time. I know he isn't because the general ed teacher is marking his schedule! \n\nI HATE being put in this situation. I have liked the resource teacher, and she has gone above and beyond in other ways for my son. But he NEEDS the aid. In fact, I think he needs all of his time in the general ed class to be supported with an aid! He is level two autistic, BIG need for stims, likely ADHD. There is NO WAY a single adult can teach a classroom of kids and teach\/manage him. His general ed teacher has confirmed this. We are supposed to be tracking his behaviors with and without support, but I doubt the fact that he isn't GETTING the support is being taken into account, so all of that data is bullshit. At parent-teacher conferences, we introduced ourselves to the gym teacher and he was like 'yeah! I love your son! \n\nDuring gym I play music and he just vibes with the speaker'. I asked if he ever participates in gym and he said 'oh...maybe a little if we are doing something like tag'. The goal IS NOT just for my son to be in the same room as other children. The goal is for my son to get the same education as other children and to do that, he needs support. He needs how to play modeled for him, he needs language modeled for him. \n\nI sent a big email to the principal, vice principal, general ed teacher, resource teacher, and the senior resource teacher outlining that I know he isn't getting his aid minutes and demanding a timesheet for the aid that will be sent home daily and if my son is scheduled for support, that I am called or told any time he doesn't have it. \n\nI shouldn't have to have the general ed teacher spying on the aid. It should not be this damn hard to get his support that he is entitled to via federal law.\n\n  \nAdvice and thoughts welcome.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1g0l5t2\/i_figured_advocacy_would_be_a_parttime_job_but\/","main_id":"1g0l5t2","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-10 15:15:32"}

Long winded post. ","selftext":"I\u2019m posting here out of desperation, does anyone else have trouble with their kids schools? I have 3 daughters 4,11, and 14. 4 and 14 are diagnosed ADHD, 11 is diagnosed ASD. I, 37m am also diagnosed ADHD, I was diagnosed as an adult at 34, so I\u2019m still working through relearning how to function with medication. Anyway, 11 has been in 3 different schools, local public school, homeschool\/ charter school hybrid (during covid), and now a charter school. 4 also goes to her school. 11 is HIGH functioning, she\u2019s smart, creative, caring, and whimsical. She\u2019s nice to everyone, I don\u2019t think she has a mean bone in her body. Her major issues are social. She \u201cfriends\u201d too hard. She gives gifts, notes, drawings, these aren\u2019t bad traits but she over does it and comes on WAY too strong. Combined with her whimsical and \u201cweird\u201d nature (her words not mine, she\u2019s very self aware) kids tend to want to be friends with her, but then very quickly distance themselves from her. She gets very attached, she gets upset if friends want to sit by someone else, or do something without her. Then she thinks they don\u2019t like her and she gets more obsessive, this causes these kids to be a little more mean to her to push her away. She worked her way through half a dozen new best friends in last years class. Now this year she\u2019s earned this reputation of the weird girl which she doesn\u2019t care about, but the kids tease her a lot. Now, what we can\u2019t tell is whether these kids are truly targeting her to bully her or if they\u2019re just teasing her like kids do. We haven\u2019t witnessed it, and the teachers are no help. She tends to be extra sensitive and has difficulty with sarcasm and joking around, she can\u2019t really grasp the concept of \u201cshit talk\u201d when it\u2019s just in good fun. \n\nShe has made one very good friend, he\u2019s 11 as well with ASD, and he is almost exactly like her in every way. So now there\u2019s two of them. The school has uniforms (collared polo shirts of any color, tan or blue pants\/ shorts\/ skirts\/ dresses) so they dress alike, eat lunch together and in general they just do their thing. The school actually followed through with our (my wife and I, and his parent) request to put them in the same class this year. It\u2019s been good for the first month or so, but now they are both getting teased (or bullied) for hanging with \u201cthe weird kid\u201d. \n\nNow a little more backstory on my 11, having two other neuro-spicy daughters and myself, we have our hands full! 11 and 14 go to counseling, and 11 also did \u201ctheraplay\u201d for about 4 months to work on bonding. But that was a temporary thing. 11 has trouble with intrusive thoughts, she doesn\u2019t realize that we all have them, and it\u2019s normal to have these thoughts as long as we don\u2019t act on them. Her social problems lead her to a darker path of intrusive thoughts though. When my wife started working full time again two years ago and 11 was having major separation problems. She had a pretty violent intrusive thought, \u201cwhat would happen if I took this knife and stabbed mom while she\u2019s sleeping\u201d. She immediately came to terms with how horrible that is, and she got very upset about why she even thought that. She talked to us immediately about it, and we immediately emailed her counselor. She\u2019s has more thoughts but less violent. Her counselor told us these intrusive thoughts are actually her way of coping with her anxiety and they aren\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. By having the thought she puts herself in control of the situation. She can now control whether it happens or not. But if she acts on any of them, that obviously becomes the problem. This was about two years this happened, and she tells us almost everytime she has a bad intrusive thought because it scares her. Well last night she acted on one, she was emptying the dishwasher as a chore, and she took a knife and scratched her arm with it. Not a slice or a deep cut, just a surface scratch with the tip of the knife. Enough to bleed a little, but not serious. It looks like a small cat scratch. But it\u2019s not about the injury, it\u2019s about the fact she acted on it. She immediately regretted it and came to tell us, we had a very long talk about it. She also had a virtual therapy appointment that morning, and the topic of her past intrusive thoughts came up and whether they were getting better or worse. So she was reminded of it and it was fresh in her mind. We don\u2019t think she is suicidal or has thoughts of self harm on a regular basis, this may be an isolated incident because it was fresh in her mind. It\u2019s not something we are going to take lightly and ignore but the possibility of this being an act out or grasp for attention is on our minds. As we talked to her she was telling us she thinks she is depressed and scared to go to school because she is being \u201cbullied\u201d. Again, I\u2019m not blaming her as the victim, but knowing her level of sensitivity and how difficult it is for her to read social queues we can\u2019t assume yet that it\u2019s true bullying or her interpretation of bullying. The only relevance would be how we go about handling it, if it\u2019s real bullying we need to be more vigilant with the school, if it\u2019s regular teasing, it\u2019s something we need to help her with more on our end. \n\nObviously we want to help our daughter in anyway she needs but it\u2019s so hard when we are building this huge thing in our minds through her interpretation of what might be happening. It\u2019s bullying to her regardless, we just don\u2019t know how to help her. She was only diagnosed earlier this year, and she is going in next month for a full evaluation so the school is refusing to set up an IEP or a 504 without the evaluation. On top of that, they\u2019re understaffed and they drag their heels. Realistically her IEP will get set up a month or two before she moves on to the middle school. We are at a loss, we don\u2019t know what to do aside from bubble wrapping the house, hiding all the sharp things, and setting up blink cameras inside the house to monitor her, and those are just acts of desperation. I don\u2019t even know if there is advice out there for us, or if I just want to vent this out there to someone who is in the trenches with us just for the sake of solidarity. The only other thing we can think of is switching her back into the local public school, there are still going to be bullies, and the special ed department is still lacking, but there are 3x as many kids, maybe she\u2019ll have a better chance of finding her people there, the more \u201cweird\u201d kids there are, the more \u201cnormal\u201d the weird becomes. Again, I don\u2019t like labeling weird or normal, but she really leans in to her \u201cweird\u201d personality and she wears it pridefully so I\u2019m choosing to use it in her context ha ha. I keep telling her this is her way of weeding out the people that she doesn\u2019t want to have as friends, and the ones who stick around are her true friends, but it\u2019s hard for her when there\u2019s a 10-1 classmate to friend ratio. Does anyone have any advise to give to an 11 year old on how to deal with bullies?

My son almost 3, has been attending this great program since July for two hours Monday through Friday. Now a spot has opened up for him in the full day program (which we are eligible for through our insurance, so him aging out of EI isn\u2019t really a problem) and I\u2019ve started the paper work. But we toured some facilities as we were suggested by the CPSE chairperson and our OSC as my son is aging out of EI. \nWhile I love the program he\u2019s in, there are many benefits for us as a family for him to attend the preschool program through CPSE. It may seem selfish but if he attends the full day program he would not be eligible to take the bus anymore, not a big deal, but I\u2019m sure after a while it will start to put a strain on us, with our work schedules. There\u2019s a copay of $15 everyday up to $2000, which isn\u2019t an issue except, He has ABA now at home 10 hours a week. And while it\u2019s expensive to pay his therapist privately, we love her so much we\u2019re more than willing to pay her out of pocket to continue his therapy at home. So one of those would have to give. If he goes to pre-k we can keep his at home therapist. Idk what to do. Idk what to choose. He\u2019s made great progress in the program he\u2019s in now but I\u2019m torn. I\u2019m worried about the transition, and I\u2019m feeling super bad because both facilities have sent me paper work to complete so he can start on Monday. \nI should add, I was originally not expecting for our insurance to approve the full day program, which is why I went on the tours. When I got the call he\u2019d been approved\u2026 I had already decided on a pre school\u2026 so either way I need to make a choice now, and make a call that\u2019s gonna really annoy someone at either of these programs.

The way that she speaks (mainly just stating facts of what she observes) and her repetitive movements (jumping when excited) don\u2019t make this a surprise. But I\u2019m a bit shocked at what I read in the diagnosis - \n\nFirst off, I thought psychology was science. It reads like some stream of consciousness babble from the psychologist. Things like \u201cwhen we sat down during the second meeting, R came up to me and said she wanted to sit on my lap\u201d - what does this signify?!\n\nIt says she had trouble potty-training - she didn\u2019t, we got that done within 2 weeks before age 3. \n\nIt says she still wets the bed - she doesn\u2019t, all I said that for a week after an extended hospital stay she was wetting the bed, but this went away on its own months ago.\n\nThe psychiatrist\u2019s diagnosis that\u2019s attached to that just seems like a copy-paste of autism symptoms, many of which my daughter does not have. For example, she does not have issues with transition and doesn\u2019t have emotional outbursts. Yet in the diagnosis it says that she does?!\n\nGrateful to now have access to support services, but let\u2019s just say that the \u201cquality\u201d of this diagnosis is leaving me frustrated. They also did not give us access to the ADOS-2 scores, just said she scored highly.\n\nShould I care? Should I just take this and run with the support services? Does this matter, or is the fact that we have the diagnosis the only important thing here (and not what\u2019s written in it?)\n","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1g0paii\/daughter_just_got_diagnosed\/","main_id":"1g0paii","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-10 18:14:49"}

When younger it was finding something he liked then basically trying to embody it completely. And, it would be a focus area, until eventually it just wasn\u2019t. Then, move onto something else and repeat behaviors. But, eventually circling back to old focuses\/interests for a time, back and forth. Ie: a beloved band or character, liking only them and wanting same hair, way to dress, things liked, etc. A couple years though, he began grown into being able to like multiple things, bands, etc and not having to fully try being and looking like them. But, he also began questioning gender or orientation. Back and forth: straight for a few months, trans for a few months, possibly bi for a few months, wait nevermind, back and forth. With this, I see the same exact pattern as his interests and previous identity stuff mentioned. But this is of course so much bigger and more confusing. From our view, and therpist believes it \u2018might\u2019 be too, that as he finds as he gets older he doesn\u2019t quite fit in with any particular group, but feels more comfortable with females, and isn\u2019t a typical rough and tumble boy, he may be assuming it means he\u2019s not wanting to be male.  I worry for him and don\u2019t want anyone influencing him one way or the other, as it\u2019s important for him to find who he truly is, not just gender. But I think he needs therapy again and I\u2019m not sure what to start or how to get him the right help and for ALL the identity issues as I believe it\u2019s all for similar reasons. Idk has anyone seen this in their autistic kids? Finding identity is of course a challenge for everyone, but I suspect so much more difficult for children with autism. He is also High Function and seems very aware of any differences he may have and tries hard to hide them. Poor kid. \n\nThe other thing is it seems like maybe some executive function issues may be there. He knows directions for example, but almost always, unless he knows he\u2019s being watched for it, he will turn the wrong way at first before eventually correcting himself or being told. And, doesn\u2019t seem to have responded that are quick when needed like, picking up something freezing and registering quickly to let it go or whatever is needed. But when he had a school eval done they said they didn\u2019t find any processing issues, etc only communication and social. His Psy eval prior to that said slightly low processing plus the communication and social. Idk but it worries us for things where he maybe need to make quick decisions, especially where safety is concerned.

The 27th concluded the eval. & when we got the results back I cried. \nI cried a cry of relief because FINALLY myself and my husband could get a grasp of what has been transpiring and efficiently equip. ourselves in all the knowledge and resources available. Most importantly and this has always been a steady goal with A is do everything in our power to ensure his safety and development.  But I also cried because my sweet boy will forever be labeled and limited to some degree. It was a sad, happy day. Now months later as I almost completed the entire recomm. list I sit here feeling defeated once again. \nPlease, please someone tells me this gets better. What am I doing wrong? \n","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1g10i9c\/i_feel_defeated_lately\/","main_id":"1g10i9c","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-11 03:15:32"}

We were swapped classrooms, we found out when we arrived at the new building in our new city.  We were told by the special education office that we would have one teacher, and that she was an amazing teacher, and at our first drop off it was a different teacher, who was a sub last year and took the class as teacher for the first time this year.  She had no clue who our daughter was on the day.  Learned she had ASD from us during drop off.  Probably not her fault but wasn't a great first impression.  \n\nThere are 7 kids in the class, one teacher, two aides.  All of the kids but one have ASD.\n\nOn our daughters first bus day, my wife texted to ask how it was going at the end of the day.  My daughter is very smart, she understands directions but does not use words to communicate.  Per the teacher, she refused to open her eyes walking into the building, and then refused to walk from the doorway to the class.  They put her in a wagon and brought her to class.  She was upset the whole time, and loud about it.  \n\nHere's where it went south for us.  She said she told her **\"we don't fake cry\"** and carried her to the quiet corner until she was ready to come out and participate in class.  It went over my head, but my wife was instantly upset about that.  I get it, now.  Our daughter has no concept of faking anything.  She is entirely transparent.  When she's unhappy, she makes unhappy noises.  It's not a fake cry.  In fact, generally, autistic kids are not going to have the social aptitude to fake distress.  It's really distress.  I mean, we literally just moved from the only home she'd ever lived in to an entirely new environment and it was her first 2 minutes in a new classroom.  If I think about what I would have said, it would have been something comforting like \"it's ok, you can wait over here until whenever you're ready to come see your new friends, we'll be excited for you to come play and learn with us.\"  \n\nUnfortunately, my wife has lost total faith in this teacher.

We left a previous psychiatrist due to personal reasons and this psychiatrist was the next closest doctor to us in our very limited provider list (thanks government). When we made the switch to this psychiatrist 11 months ago, my son was thriving in school, so I asked if we could keep the same medication for now and change as needed. He agreed. My son uses Daytrana (methlyphenidate patches) due to having issues swallowing almost all medication. Sometime earlier this spring, i noticed him having very small bouts of aggression and restlessness. I brought this up to his psychiatrist, and he recommended Respridone for afternoon use. We gave that a shot\u2026 however, didn\u2019t see much of a change behavioral wise but the weight gain \/ gynecomastia in 4 months time was absolutely alarming. \n\nOn September 17th, we had to be cleared for a dental surgery by his pediatrician before going to the hospital. His pediatrician asked how he was doing and I told her we are still having bouts of aggression in the evening and brought up his weight, she asked if his psychiatrist was tracking his prolactin levels since regularly and I told her he never has. She said at our next monthly appointment with him, we should ask to try a different med \/ ask to send him out for labs to check his levels. We are cleared for the dental procedure and that honestly seemed to be very traumatic for my kiddo because in the weeks afterwards he didn\u2019t really seem himself. \n\nOn October 4th, we had our regularly scheduled monthly meeting (phone call) with his psychiatrist, he usually just asks how my son is doing and sends out the script, whole thing taking about 3 minutes. This time, I told him that I am not seeing a positive change with the Respridone, can we please try a different medication but keep the daytrana? He told me no - he would be stopping both medications and prescribing him liquid sertraline. I asked him what he would prescribe him for his ADHD and he said nothing. He wants to try this route instead for now to treat his aggressive behavior. I told him I didn\u2019t understand and asked for a better explanation of his thought process - he was audibly irritated with my questions and said that the sertraline would help with impulse control and hyperactivity. He was giving him two weeks of the sertraline and we would meet back in 2 weeks to see how he\u2019s doing and to discuss more and pretty much hung up. When i went to pick up the prescription the next day to give it a try over the weekend, i spoke with the pharmacist and gave her a lot of insight to our situation and asked her if this seemed right (ripping my kiddo off of his patch medication that he has been taking for almost 2 years cold turkey and starting an antidepressant) and she was puzzled at his choice as well. \n\nOn Oct 9th, I made a call his psychiatrist office to make our 2 week follow up appointment. My son has been more aggressive than he ever has been - he has never hit, kicked and bit his paraprofessionals or teacher at school before. The receptionist answers, I gave her my son\u2019s name, she put me on a brief hold and then came back and said \u201cDr. I\u2014, is no longer his doctor. He has terminated his patient relationship with Connor\u201d I surely gasped and said what! Why?? She told me she didn\u2019t know. I said when?? She told me she didn\u2019t know. I asked if I could speak to the doctor because he quite literally just started my kiddo on a brand new medication that HE prescribed 5 days ago!! She said that he was not in and only left instruction to refer him out to Texas Children\u2019s hospital psychiatry unit! I\u2019m just at a complete loss at how a doctor could do this to my child!!! My kiddo had the worst day at school today and was sent home about 1:00pm - I could tell that he was really going through it when I picked him up, he had to be restrained at school because he had started charging \/ throwing things all throughout his classroom, biting his teacher\u2026. It will be a month before we can get into Texas Children\u2019s. I am just so upset and needed to type this out to this community mostly for reassurance that I will find the care my son deserves.

I'm extremely positive he is on the spectrum. \n\nI'm just curious what happened with an incident that I've never experienced before. \n\nHe went to get his teeth cleaned Tuesday afternoon. This was his best visit ever, honestly. He actually let them BRUSH his teeth. Usually they can only look at them due to his extreme gag reflex. Everything went well but we were there for about an hour and fifteen minutes. As we were going home he did keep saying how much he wanted to be home! I went home straight away but I'm like 35 minutes from the dentist. About 15 minutes from home he asked about going to a hotel. He loves hotels bc they have elevators. I told him we weren't going to a hotel. \n\nHe broke out in a huge fit! Crying, kicking, screaming, pulling the window screen, he left a mark on his neck from his seat belt runbbing! It was the worst fit he has experienced in a very long time! I stopped at the playground, that is a few minutes from home, and offered to get out and play. He absolutely refused and cried all the way home. He didn't calm down until we got home and I was able to really hold him and talk to him. Then it was over as quickly as it began. \n\nWhat happened? I read that sometimes when autistic ppl are in settings where they have to mask, then they ultimately have to let it out later. Is that what happened? His older sister was with us bc we always have to have someone in the back seat with him when we go places. Even she couldn't figure it out or help and she's very good at that stuff with him. \n\nI was just wondering what your thoughts are?

Earlier this year my husband went away for work across the country for 3 months and under his advice, I enrolled my boys into a home daycare. \n\nI had always kept my children with me as I don\u2019t work so I didn\u2019t \u2018need\u2019 daycare services. Initially I had enquired with a specific pre school that was only for autistic children but turned the spot down because the home daycare educator I was looking at for my NT 1 year old had said she\u2019d love to look after both of my children, had experience working with children with autism and was very confident. This was after I shared with her that my son had been knocked back by many daycares as they weren\u2019t confident working with an autistic child. She really reassured me. \n\nUpon starting my 3 year old was non verbal and relied on pointing or hand leading. Quite quickly we started to see incredible language use and development, improved social interactions, gross and fine motor skills so in our eyes- she was quite the blessing!\n\nGiven that we were having so much success under her care, I recommended her services to my best friend for her NT (ADHD) 3 year old son. Together we raise our boys as family so we are very close. \n\nI\u2019d say all 3 of our boys attended daycare together for maybe 3\/4 months now. We both loved our alone time during school days. \n\nAgain, their teacher was awesome and communication flowed so easy with her. \n\nAbout 4\/5 weeks ago my 3 year old would keep telling me after pickup that \u201cmiss T angry at me.\u201d I took that with a grain of salt because he also tells me his papa is angry at him too, when really his dad has only told him he\u2019s not allowed to ride his bike inside. I truly thought his teacher was setting boundaries with him that he didn\u2019t like. \n\nBut deep down I had a strange gut instinct about it that I kept repressing because I simply tried to be logical and in hindsight this is all my fault. \n\nTheir teacher was great and never had any concerns about my son. Would often make comments that \u201cno one would be able to tell he\u2019s autistic.\u201d Conversation and communication flowed so seamlessly with her and we often had conversations about our personal lives together. In my mind that was a way for me to explain my child more. She soon found my social media profile and would comment on things, which I didn\u2019t reply to because I felt it was getting a bit too close for comfort, however I never confronted it as like I suggested, I got along so well with her. \n\nI don\u2019t know why but last Tuesday I had the feeling that I should keep my boys home from school and felt so deeply that I needed to be close to them because I was convinced something was going to happen. I like to believe I\u2019m very in tune with my children. So I kept them home and we had a great day. \n\nLast Thursday I received a worried call from my best friend saying she needed to tell me what her son had shared with her. \n\nShe explained that on the way to dropping her son at school that he randomly said \u201cmiss T is very scary to C (my son)\u201d she asked some more questions, including how and why? To which he responded that \u201cmiss T is scary to C when he does a poo in his nappy and not on the toilet.\u201d\n\nI made it abundantly clear when I first signed my boys up that my husband and I don\u2019t put any pressure on C to achieve and milestones that peers his age may, that we very much let him do things in his own time. About potty training, he will let us know when he\u2019s ready but that we were going to gently try this coming summer. I\u2019m in Australia so our summer is during the US Winter just for context. She said she had no problem changing nappies as she was going to be changing my 1 year old sons anyway and respected our wishes. \n\nAfter what my friends son said it kind of all made sense. It was that morning that C requested to wear his new Dinosaur underwear without a nappy. About an hour later I requested him to try and go to the toilet where he had some visceral reaction that he\u2019s never had before. He went into full panic attack mode, was distraught and kept saying \u201cC sorry mama, I do wee on toilet now, mama angry at C.\u201d I explained to my friend it was a very unexpected response. \n\nAfter what my friend shared with me, I told my husband. We sat down with C to talk about it and without asking any leading questions, he offered to that \u201cmiss T smack C on the face.\u201d That night he didn\u2019t sleep until after midnight because every 10\/15 minutes he kept telling me the same thing. He finally slept when I told him he was never going to school with Miss T again. \n\nI had my husband message miss T that our sons were going to be absent and emailed the daycare company she works under to explain we wanted our sons to be removed from care effective immediately. \n\nSince then, he\u2019s stuck to his story. He doesn\u2019t yet understand the concept of WHY but he has physically demonstrated how miss T hurt him, with an open palm and aggressive smack on his cheek. We don\u2019t bring the topic up, we just allow him to tell us whatever he needs to. \n\nJust last night I was popping a pimple at my vanity that\u2019s next to a window where a helicopter was flying overhead. He said \u201cmum, police man helicopter get naughty miss T, take to jail.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve spoken to the company director who has fired her immediately because outside of the complaint I and my friend made, they could see that Miss T was marking my children as attended on days I have proof that they didn\u2019t, Tuesday to be exact when I had that gut feeling. That means that my husband and I were paying for days we didn\u2019t use. The company has made an official report to the relevant authorities. \n\nThis morning we had a family friend social worker come and talk to our son off the books who again, stuck to his story. He was far too precise and demonstrated sufficient clarity of the events. So while we don\u2019t have any concrete proof, we have full faith in our son. We don\u2019t smack in our household, it\u2019s a foreign concept and not something that\u2019s in character for our boys to know. \n\nOur family friend explained that abusers target the most vulnerable because she thought she could get away with it knowing his communication isn\u2019t perfect. My friend has also removed her son from Miss T\u2019s services. \n\nWell damn. I am the worst mother. I doubted the severity of my son\u2019s complaints, one thing I didn\u2019t know I was doing and swore I\u2019d never do if I seen red flags. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to support him, my husband or myself. This has completely f\u2019d up my trust and to be quite honest, it\u2019s reinforced the idea that I\u2019ll never be able to die because I can\u2019t trust leaving C in this world. \n\nWhat\u2019s even more twisted is that I actually feel sympathy for Miss T. Why?? WHY? She hurt my SON???? She\u2019s now jobless, with no way to pay her rent.

(long rant hehe) ","selftext":"So we have an asd 3 year old. He was diagnosed last year but i\u2019ve \u201cknown\u201d he\u2019s autistic since he turned 12 months. During this time, NOBODY has been there for us or our son. Family on both sides have distanced themselves from us. \n\nMy family started excluding my son as of last year. If we are included (usually with the sibling I share a mom with), nobody ever tries to interact or get to know my son. they don\u2019t try to make him laugh or anything. I get he\u2019s non verbal and not \u201ctypical\u201d like their children BUT I believe if they truly love us and our son, they\u2019d try to build a relationship with him. He\u2019s no longer invited to anything.\n\nMy partners family has not been involved since official diagnosis, they don\u2019t come visit him or anything. if they do, no interaction as well. His dad and sister, who live a mile down the road, won\u2019t ever visit him UNLESS our neurotypical 2 year old niece comes to visit and that\u2019s only because her parents (partners brother) come stay with us. Neurotypical niece gets all the attention. I love her but I get upset that my partners family only comes around my son when NT niece is in town but not any other time of year as if we don\u2019t live close by. \n\nAnyway, this caused a huge argument last night. Which was \u201cresolved\u201d between us but now i\u2019m wondering how you all deal with this. Last night, my partner was accusing me of being the \u201cbad\u201d one because I mentioned how upset it makes me that his dad and sister only come around when NT niece is in town but never care about our son year round. He mentioned to his brother who is visiting that we\u2019re going to the pumpkin patch this sunday and invited them BUT guess who is coming? his dad. it just irks me so much that his family only wants to be involved when NT niece is here. Why can\u2019t my son be loved without her being around? Why can\u2019t anyone build a relationship with him?\n\nMy partner got upset with me and started yelling at me talking about he wants to make memories which is valid, BUT i can\u2019t get past the FACT that they treat my son like he\u2019s nothing and he\u2019s non existent. Why does that not bother him? My son comes first to me, which goes back to how I\u2019ve distanced myself from MY family for the way they simply don\u2019t care about my son. \n\nSorry I don\u2019t want my son to be half-a**ed loved. I hate the idea of forcing anybody to love him. He\u2019s autistic, doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t deserve to be loved. He deserves to be included. He deserves for his family to care enough to learn to interact with him. Is it wrong to distance ourselves from these people who are supposed to be \u201cfamily\u201d? or is it something we simply put up with? \n\nI\u2019m the last one to have a baby from my siblings, they all have had at least 3+ kids and i\u2019ve been there for every single one. My son is diagnosed and we just don\u2019t exist. Meanwhile my partner thinks we put up with it for \u201cmemories\u201d and in case his dad passes one day. As if I don\u2019t wish life was perfect in the sense that both sides of family were a village for us. I WISH. but it\u2019s not the reality. I guess i\u2019m just overprotective of my son. He deserves better.

Our pediatrician sent home assessments for us and her teacher a few years ago but we never took the next step and pursued an official diagnosis beyond that because she said she had everything she needed to write a note for any accommodations for school our daughter might need. This year our 2yr old was diagnosed with lvl 1 ASD, so I figured we might as well get our older daughter officially diagnosed so we can pursue therapy for coping mechanisms specific to ADHD for her in the event that she starts struggling in the future. \n\nThe psychologist that evaluated our daughter asked us if we'd ever considered that she may be on the spectrum as well and asked if she'd ever showed signs as a toddler. I tried to recall anything and mainly just remember her being an absolute terror between 2 and 4 years old. I couldn't take her anywhere without meltdowns and her trying to run away from me in public. We ended up just staying home a lot and I had my MIL watch her if I needed to go to the store. It sucked, but she's slowly evened out over the years. Getting into gifted classes in school has helped a lot with her behavior there and I've just learned to deal with her tornado of mess at home. \n\nI started recalling her odd behaviors with her shoes and sometimes clothes. She had little Mary Jane type shoes with straps that she wore every day and we couldn't leave the house until they were tight enough. She would sit and un-strap and re-tighten the strap that goes across the top of the shoe over and over and over again. We'd end up being late for appointments and I'd get frustrated and just pick her up and put her in her car seat and hand her the shoes so she could un-strap and re-tighten them in the car. She was sensitive about clothes and the seams on her socks and always very particular about those things and they always needed to be *just so*. She wouldn't line things up like my youngest does but she would arrange her little tea set pieces  and dolls or stuffes exactly so and have a meltdown if they fell over or got moved at all. \n\nOur daughter never toe walked or did any noticeable stimming that I recall but she would, um, touch herself anytime she got upset or overwhelmed. It wasn't too bad at home but when she started an early pre-school they mentioned that I was a problem as she was running to a corner and doing it multiple times during the school day. We started putting her in tights under shorts and never sent her in dresses or skirts. We eventually pulled her out of that facility and the issue seemed to resolve itself by the time she started pre-k. \n\nI've been going back over everything I can remember from her early childhood and worrying that I missed something. What behaviors did you notice in your AuDHD children and how have they changed over time? Are some behaviors more prevalent as they've gotten older and have other behaviors disappeared? \n\nThanks in advance.

I definitely found the time to do it lol...yawn.\n\nClearly, Claire Danes deserves significant praise for this role. I've never been invited into neurodivergency in *such an emotional way.* I felt like looking at myself and my definitions, my unconscious bias, my selfishness and inability to trust people. \n\nI thought of my kids the entire time, like, \"that's totally something my daughter\/son does!\" But the neurodivergency in Temple would probably be more in line with Asperger's these days. And that's totally fine, because as Asperger's stands today, there's no proof that all neurodivergency is and independent motive in the brain. In order to function as others expect, they are living in a quantum world of creation, which keeps some hyper focused kids from understanding social skills. It's a curious trigger, just naturally wanting to avoid touching another person. I mean, our whole mission in life is to protect the people you love however you can. That's human survival. Yet, could humans survive together with neurodivergencies as the common denominator, no social skills required. All of our minds working the same as Temple's, pushed by our own destinies. \n\n\nI can't explain the feeling of finally understanding and fully embracing abstraction. We push for a safe world of absolution, even hope. Both of which are a total hindrance to the neurodivergent, as absolution creates shadow instead of the light and freedom from shadows practicing acceptance and abstraction --get into their minds with them however you can. Explain emotions and the emotional steps we go through in traumatic times. I can help them to expect it, and that they'll get through, and that Dad will always be there however I can. \n\nI'm so proud to know my kids. They've helped me to finally unlearn how I learn, and to bring some light into shadows they hold onto have trouble talking about. Ok, it's, cool, just remember I'm here. I set my daughter up with a therapist, which she's been enjoying. Medicaid helped me find a gym for my son to go to a few days per week. He likes to spin, of course, so they have some fun stuff to do.\n\nAbstraction is fantastic. There's so many possible sides to *everything,* and *nothing* has to be set in stone unless they decide to take on absolution. We all do once we learn who the hell we even are. Then you live to learn you're nothing like you painted yourself to be then, and you can do what you like. But, to keep going, you have to give the gifts inside away to others. If we could only figure that one out without good 'ol selfishness butting in. \n\nAbsolution vs Abstraction is the constant force we must be aware of. They translate better to Fate vs Destiny. Blessings to you all and your worlds that are changing daily. This is how it's going to be, and you are chosen to go forward. And you wouldn't have been chosen if you couldn't handle it. You're the one. And we can sit back and say, nature's cruel. This sucks. Just because nature is cruel doesn't mean we have to be. \u2665\ufe0f\n\nFinally, something that makes sense after all these years. What freedoms they must enjoy, that we can only imagine a split second of their creative chaos. That would be something.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1g27pjx\/how_the_film_temple_grandin_helped_my_parenting\/","main_id":"1g27pjx","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-12 19:23:32"}

My kid is obsessed with cars, car logos, car names, car parts, all of it. So I notice husband and kiddo are standing an looking at a Jeep for a few extra seconds and i stop and walk back to them. Kiddo points out the the jeep is hurty. Looks like it had been in a wreck and part of the grill was broken. \n\n  \nI start to say to him \"is that what you want to do when you grow up? Be a doctor for hurty cars? That's called a mechanic.\" But just as I start to say \"Mechanic,\" the alarm goes off on the car and my kid yells and throws his hands over his ears. We get him away from the car ASAP and back to our own. I ask my husband if he touched the car, because kiddo has been told he's not supposed to, and husband says, no, we never touched it. \n\n  \nHusband is getting kiddo set up in car seat while I'm balancing our leftovers in my arms and some guy pulls up next to me and yells something out the window, which I can't hear. I realize it's the Jeep from earlier and the guys is yelling something about not touching other people vehicles. I don't remember exactly how he said it but it was something like \"you shouldn't mess with other people's vehicles\" or \"and that's why you shouldn't mess with other people's vehicles,\" but he was PISSED. \n\nI get confused in confrontational situations and it took me a second to put together that he thought we were trying to do something nefarious with his car - because, you know, families with preschoolers are usually trying to boost grills in parking lots - and so I get close enough that I don't need to yell and say \"oh, I'm so sorry. My son is autistic and he really loves cars. He knows not to touch them, but he was worried because your car had an ouchie.\" \n\nThis guys face just totally changes and he goes. \"oh.\" and then he's quiet for a second and says \"ok sorry about that thank you for clearing that up\" and then drives away as quickly as is legal in a parking lot. \n\nI'm still super confused and feeling very \"why are humans?\" and get in the car. I explain to husband what happened. Very slowly i realize - WE didn't set the alarm off. He saw us and used his panic button to scare us. A little kid who was interested in his car. And then he felt bad because he found out the kid was autistic. \n\nThen I cried on the way home because I just really hate people sometimes. I'm just such a delicate effing flower and I can't believe that people would really care so much about their car as to want to scare a preschooler. Sigh.  Why are people? \n\n(PS, yes, we do talk to our son about not touching things and now he understands what we mean when we explain the alarm might go off. We are making sure he understands about not touching other people or their property.)

C will be interviewed, with his father and\/or I present. This will have the potential to go to court. \n\nThis morning I impulsively decided to go to miss T\u2019s house and request my children\u2019s spare clothes, shoes and C\u2019s favourite hat. \n\nInitially all was well. I kept things short. I didn\u2019t even want to be there but his favourite hat is no longer stocked so I felt I owed him at least that. \n\nThis woman handed over my boys belongings and had the audacity to say \u201ccan I ask what\u2019s happened?\u201d\n\nI said she knew what happened, my son and my friends son are alleging you laid hands on them. She of course denied the accusations and went on to tell me that I KNOW her and I KNOW she wouldn\u2019t do this. I said I believe my son and the other child. \n\nShe changed the topic insultingly by saying \u201cmore than these allegations, I\u2019ve lost my business over admin stuff! I\u2019ve had my business for 10 years. \u201c \n\nI straight up told her I don\u2019t give a F, that she\u2019s a sick puppy who targeted a disabled child who she KNEW couldn\u2019t communicate to tell me and that if she ever touches my children again she doesn\u2019t want to know what will happen. I f\u2019d up threatening her. It came out too quickly for me to realise what I said. \n\nAnyway I ended the conversation and left. \n\nSince then she called the police for a welfare check on MY son!!!!!???????? The police came to our home when I had just gotten myself and my children into the bubble bath. \n\nOf course my children were fine and I let the officers know I did confront her this morning, that it was my fault but I did go there only with intentions to collect our belongings and that it was her who opened the conversation up. \n\nThis is just crazy and never in a million years did I think this could or would happen. Please learn from my mistakes folks- if your gut is telling you something is up.. SOMETHING IS UP. \n\nI don\u2019t condone my actions. I now have more to punish myself for. \n\nSo I guess we wait! \n\nOh and if I ever don\u2019t post again, maybe I have been arrested for threatening the lady who smacked my children in the face\u2026 allegedly of course. \n\nYES CHILDREN. She also smacked my 1 year old. However I did have a little giggle when I learnt that after she smacked my 1 year old- he smacked her right back! I just know he will defend himself and his brother throughout life. \n\nWell wishes to all and again, thank you for the support. Please feel free to pull me up on taking things too far in my interactions with Miss T. My disgust got the better of me, it\u2019s still not ok.

I have no proof, it\u2019s just a suspicion. I am so torn and I go back and forth in my feelings. I have a pretty good relationship with this man because he has worked with my daughter for a year. So I don\u2019t take this allegation lightly. At this point I can\u2019t just ignore the feeling. I am not sure what to do. My daughter (3) attends 20 hours a week and my son (23 months) is 40 hours. He just started two weeks ago. They can\u2019t communicate with me, but the thought of this going on is tearing me apart. \n\nThe first thing to set something off in my head was during my son\u2019s three hour evaluation for a therapy plan\/insurance approval. The first half I am present with the bcba and my son answering questions and the second half I go wait in the car. When I was getting ready to go wait in the car the Bcba says to me in a very excited tone, \u201cI would just love to do a diaper change while he\u2019s here.\u201d I was just so thrown off because this did not happen during my evaluation with my daughter. Also I never once complained about diaper changes so it would not be something needed for his treatment plan. He\u2019s not even two! Anyways when I got home I changed his diaper to check things out and everything looked okay of course, but he acted differently. He was laughing uncontrollably like every little touch was so ticklish and he was thrusting upward, like lifting his butt up. I probably would have never thought twice about asking to change his diaper but the way my son acted different than ever before has just stuck in my head. So a week after starting therapy here by son has discovered his private parts now and just wants to tug and pull. He\u2019s shoving toys and whatever he can onto himself. I understand this is a normal part of toddlerhood but it may be just too much of a coincidence that it started after 7 days in this man\u2019s care. \n\nWith my daughter she has been potty training for about 6 months. It was her BCBAs idea to start. It has been very up and down. The last week or two she has completely stopped wanting to go at home. I took her to the doctor on Friday and need to collect a urine sample to test for a uti. The last couple days it\u2019s been accident after accident. She also has very strong smelling urine and almost fishy smell down there. I never experienced any sort of smell down there with my oldest. So it is a possible sign. She also has this routine of every time we go potty she has to take off her shirt and won\u2019t go without doing that. As soon as she goes potty she gets down and does a handstand putting her head in my lap. I\u2019m so concern this is a taught behavior. But also something that could be written off as an autism quirk. My daughter wakes up with nightmares almost every night. So that is very concerning as well. This man always compliment how sweet and precious my daughter is and how pretty her eyes are. A phrase he has said multiple times is how she melts his heart and when she runs up and gives him a hug \u201cit\u2019s hard for him to stay professional\u201d. I really don\u2019t know what that means.\n\nMy daughter has shown huge improvements in her behaviors, communication and quality of life in general since starting at the clinic. I would hate to pull her and I also want my son to have the same opportunity for growth. I am so torn and go back and forth. I have requested a meeting with the lead bcba of all the clinic locations.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1g3iqvb\/i_need_advice_about_bcba\/","main_id":"1g3iqvb","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-14 15:37:41"}

I\u2019ve asked repeatedly for his homework assignments since they\u2019re never in his folder and either get gas lit that they aren\u2019t even graded or after 4x asking finally get It weeks after the fact.

Had to get a doctors note so they HAD to allow him to go. That made me cry to think he was using his words and they weren\u2019t letting him go and instead he got to sit there and relieve himself in his fucking classroom in the chair \ud83d\ude14 \n\nI reached out to a local autism moms group, got several highly recommended advocates, talked to several and found one with availability to help and can breathe.

My niece is 11 months and I\u2019ve had some concerns about her development all around. She has very low muscle as in she can stand or pull herself up or even get into a crawling position. She also can\u2019t sit up for very long without folding over or falling back. She barely learned to roll over around 9 months. Aside from this she reacts negatively to loud sounds and other children. I babysit 2 days week and I myself have a 1 & 3 year old and she absolutely cannot stand to be around them. She cries as soon as they try to play with her. She does not respond to her name or just anyone speaking to her in general. I have tried to do things like clapping or singing trying to get her to do little gestures but she just stares off. One of the more obvious signs is the continual rocking she does when she\u2019s sitting.

Unfortunately, it\u2019s not looking promising on the in home front for the new insurance.

Nope. I was met with \u201coh, well, every week?

Then one helpful solution was \u201coh well why don\u2019t you work at night?\u201d Ah, yes\u2026I\u2019ll just take care of him during the day and work all night and never sleep, sounds great. \n\nAnyone who made it this far, thank you for reading.

In the beginning, he was like an apprentice, eager to learn everything from his superiors. A few months after he joined the force, he met a girl who treated him wonderfully, showering him with kindness and respect. They quickly became passionate and soon moved in together.\n\nFor the first few years, things seemed to be going well. But after about four years, everything changed. She began to treat him poorly, showing less affection and humiliating him in public. It was heartbreaking to watch, but he forgave her every time, holding onto the hope that things would get better.\n\nThen they had a beautiful daughter, Eva. We soon discovered that as she grew, she would face significant challenges. When Eva was two, she was diagnosed with severe autism. The news shattered all of us. Her mother struggled to accept it, even calling Eva \"stupid,\" which was incredibly painful to hear.\n\nAs the years went on, the situation worsened. Rachel's mother became more and more distant, neglecting her responsibilities as a parent. My brother stepped in, doing everything he could to care for Eva, helping her every night and trying to provide the support she desperately needed.\n\nThe strain on their marriage became unbearable when his wife cheated on him multiple times. Initially, he forgave her, but after it happened again and again, it became clear that he needed to end the relationship. Eventually, they separated and divorced.\n\nNow my brother faces a daunting challenge. He\u2019s paying for ABA therapy for Eva three times a week, which costs about 400 euros a month. On top of that, there are other expenses for treatments, vitamins, and transportation. With an income of only 900 euros, he struggles to make ends meet while renting a home and managing a car that he can\u2019t truly afford.\n\nHe dreams of moving to Europe to drive trucks for better pay, but he feels lost and unsupported in that endeavor. I\u2019ve tried to discuss the idea of raising a fund for Eva's  care, but he\u2019s resistant. He doesn\u2019t want her struggles to be publicized, fearing it would only affect her future and will also break his heart further.\n\nSo, I\u2019ve been working quietly to find ways to help him and my niece without drawing attention to it. I want to support them both as much as I can, even if he doesn\u2019t realize it yet. His journey has been filled with challenges, but his dedication continues to inspire me and everyone around him.\n\nPlease let me know if this is the right way I am going on and how I can improve to get people and even family involved as I have no approval from my brother.\n\nI have videos and photos  of Eva but I am not sure if it is a great idea to post them without her father's approval.\n\nThis is the website I was talking about:\nhttps:\/\/gofund.me\/e0cefda8","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1g3urz8\/i_need_your_honest_opinion_guys\/","main_id":"1g3urz8","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-15 00:10:13"}

She seems to love it honestly, but it\u2019s some real deep compression. I can\u2019t find any information on the safety of it. Anyone have experience with this and how often kids should safely wear one? Is the whole school day too long? My daughter is 4 years old for reference. \n\nAlso this is my first post in here but I\u2019ve been a member for longer and I just want to thank those of you that post - I\u2019ve read so many helpful stories that resonated with me and advice that has helped so much. Some days are hard as you all know and this page helps me feel way less alone on the bad days.

Things he wants me to do or set up for him. Although he knows it\u2019s toilet and breakfast time first, he gets upset when I remind him of what needs to happen in our days. I will say \u201cyes we can do that, after a wee and breakfast\u201d of course, The requests and demands continue. He won\u2019t occupy himself, but keep asking while I am attempting to get breakfast ready for him and his 2yr old brother. (Helping him first just leads to him being grumpy anyway because he is hungry so I\u2019ve tried that) \n\u2022if he is not following me around demanding things, he is following his brother and taking whatever his brother is doing off him by saying \u201c[brother] after your turn it\u2019s my turn, [brother] when is it my turn and I end up having to stop what I\u2019m doing and intervene in the argument that follows (they usually escalate to hurting each other. \n\u2022Doing anything aside from what he has in his mind that he wants to do (eg eating breakfast or doing a wee) is met with SO MUCH resistance. He will refuse to go to the toilet until I am picking him up and sitting him on the toilet. He will sometimes even deliberately make a mess when he wees. I have to hand feed him breakfast because otherwise he refuses to eat. \n\u2022by the time we get around to doing what he wants to do (after an hour long song and dance trying to get him to function in the morning), I have already spent my morning arguing with him about emptying his bladder so he doesn\u2019t have an accident, and helping him eat breakfast because otherwise 5 minutes later he is whinging that he is hungry and he has likely listed 1000 other things he wants to do in the day. So I am feeling frustrated and snappy with him. And overwhelmed at all the hoops I have to jump through to keep him happy. If the requests aren\u2019t met he will tolerate it reasonably well the earlier in the day it is, towards the evening he will escalate to meltdowns\/low tolerance for anything. \n\nBackground, I am super accomodating for his requests, honestly probably too much. I always make sure I dedicate 1:1 time with him everyday to fill his cup, I cuddle him to sleep every night, I apologise to him for yelling etc when that happens. \nBut when he is like this, nothing is ever enough. He always ends up disregulated by the end of the day, I always end up frustrated with him. And in all honesty I am feeling burned out and resentful. \n\nAlso worth noting I have OCD and a big part of my obsession is ensuring my attachment relationship with my kids is \u2018positive\u2019 and hasn\u2019t had too many \u2018negative\u2019 moments to make sure they are ok. I acknowledge that when he is behaving like this I may get extra stressed about it because he is always unhappy and I am not getting the \u2018feedback or reassurance\u2019 from him that he is emotionally ok\/attached to me. This is something I am working on with my own therapist. \n\nI am wondering if this behaviour of demands\/requests is common with ASD. If there strategies that have worked for other parents I would love to hear. His OT has suggested it could be anxiety related and having a daily schedule\/visual chart may be helpful for him? Also could it be a developmental leap\/boredom? He is currently learning times tables, learning about atoms and matter, and size comparisons of different celestial objects in the universe. So very bright kiddo and I want to be helping him. \n\nI just need advice\/a hug.

This results in epic meltdows. I've learned that if I approach things in a more flexible manner, the meltdowns are less frequent. For example, I give us extra time to get us out the door in the morning. I set a timer with some leeway. I'll then give my daughter some intermittent reminders to finish up what she's doing as she has X minutes left. When the timer eventually goes off, she's usually pretty easy to transition out the door on time. Occasionally, I do still need to use a little bit of the extra cushion to allow her to finish what she's doing. But all in all, it seems like a worthwhile strategy most days.\n\nMy husband, on the other hand, wants to take a much less flexible approach. As in \"get dressed now or you're getting left\". This obviously causes huge meltdowns. I try to explain how he needs to be more flexible but he always responds that I \"always take her side\". It's gotten to the point where anything he's in charge of results in a huge meltdown. Bathing, hair brushing, getting dressed, etc. My daughter refuses to do anything like that if he's in charge. \n\nMy husband told his therapist about all the behavioral issues we have at home and his therapist said she'd send a message to our pediatrician about ODD and medications that help with Autism... My daughter has an appointment with the pediatrician in a few days to discuss her behaviors and my husband it taking her. I think he is going to push for medication for her outbursts, but I'm not sure I can get on that page. I feel like this is more of an issue that he needs to work on in himself.

So naturally, I'm very glad he finally has the opportunity for OT sessions. However, I was misinformed about what an occupational therapist actually does. Whenever I've spoken to EI or my son's teachers about help with tantrums, they say something like, \"Don't worry! OT will help with tantrums!\" However, when I met my son's OT today, she clarified that she does not \"help with tantrums\" and suggested ABA. First, my son cannot go to ABA because he only has an educational diagnosis and is still on the waitlist for a medical diagnosis. Second, the ABA centers near my house require a minimum time commitment. My son just started developmental pre-k. It's not perfect because it's only half a day, but he loves it. I don't want to change his schedule so soon. Third, my kid naps 2 hours per day. He is newly 3, but he is also high sleep needs. Not only that, he resumes private speech therapy, twice per week, next week. When will we actually make it to ABA? The OT was very nice, but she mainly wants to work on physical milestones, like coloring and scissor skills. That sounds great, and yeah; kid is way behind on those skills. On the other hand, I was very clear at the assessment that I am mainly concerned with behaviors. I was not advised about the OT's goals\/intentions until today. Kid even had a few tantrums during the session and the OT said she thought my son had trouble with transitions, but she had no tips for us to work on at home. If the OT would rather kid go to ABA for behaviors, should we give up on OT? Despite what the therapists think, it is actually a huge burden for me to log off work early and take my son to therapy several times per week (he will soon have 2 OT sessions and 2 speech sessions per week). Sorry for the rant, I know we are all going through this. Just the idea of adding in ABA--which my son doesn't even qualify for at the moment, seems like so much.

It\u2019s odd. \n- It\u2019s almost like he doesn\u2019t have joint interest, but more gets excited over things and smiles at us.

He cannot point to anything I try to show him\n-can wave hi and bye but only does it on occasion. Only gives high fives if they\u2019re hard slaps that make him laugh but won\u2019t really high five people. \n- can point to eyes and teeth when asked where they are \n-has to sleep next to me.

And by then I'm sure I've damaged her psyche and mine.\n\nI try my best to explain everything, treat her with as much autonomy that's safe to do so and breakdown why I can't talk about certain things.\n\nI am burning out again, I know I am cause after school drop-off I was walking out that gate and a kid was latched onto it screaming (I think poor dude has some problems) my mum was in the car crying for this kid and usually seeing a kid like that would make me cry too but my first thought? Half these little shits just need to be smacked. I don't smack (done it twice, tho) and I would never ever usually think that or consider it as a viable parenting option. I'm losing empathy again which is the last peice before suicidal intent.\n\n\nI'm failing to be able to see the good in PDA or wondering if I will completely snap one day at her attitude and aggression and tell her to square up.\n\nWhy does everything need to get to breaking point?!?!\nEven her dad couldn't understand NO to certain things (and more that was probably all PDA fueled and not known then) until he ended up with police intervention, court ordered therapy and a behaviour change program. I'm terrified her PDA is going to land her in police with authorities and what's worse will I be too burnt out to care?\n","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1g42zwl\/pda_autism_how_the_fuck_to_cope\/","main_id":"1g42zwl","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-15 08:33:26"}

In the last two years she's experienced explosive development in both of these areas, but her communication level has been mostly based on very concrete concepts. \"I like X,\" \"I'm happy,\" \"I want X.\" She has so far been unable to communicate about things in the future or past tense. She's just now beginning to answer W questions such as what when and where, but she's really struggled with why and who. \n\nThis morning, she was eating breakfast as I was packing her lunch for school. She looked up at me and said \"Orange chips please!\" I laughed and told her that she couldn't have barbeque Lays for breakfast.

{"post_type":"s","created_utc":1729000068.0,"subreddit":"Autism_Parenting","author":"Npopp5","link_flair":"Advice Needed","title":"All or Nothing Reaponsiveness","selftext":"I posted about my son here (just turned 7 yo, ASD) a few years ago. I\u2019m writing again to see if anyone has any thoughts or ideas about strategies, or from personal experience has any theories about what might be going on and\/or what might help.\n\nThe great news is overall my son has made a lot of progress and is now able to have full  conversations with us sometimes. He has a good vocabulary, decent speech, and has really improved at his ability to play and talk with neurotypical kids, sometimes at length. However, in addition to mild to moderate challenges related to sound sensitivity, reading comprehension, taking turns, etc, by far his biggest challenge is periods of time where he becomes completely non-responsive or sometimes just very hypo-responsive to most outside stimulus. I do not think it is selective mutism bc he does not have social anxiety of any kind (he is actually the opposite of shy when he is in the mood). It is not seizures because he clearly is still stimming\/engaging in activity and usually thinking about things. It is also definitely not an issue with hearing. \n\nFrom observation and what he has occasionally told us after the fact, it appears to be that often he is so focused on his thoughts and imagination involving his interests (insects, snakes, Minecraft, ghosts\/monsters), that he can\u2019t or won\u2019t switch to answering or responding to conversation or indeed, responding to almost any outside stimulus at all. I have read about immersive\/maladaptive daydreaming and although I can\u2019t be sure, that appears from the outside to be somewhat similar to what is going on. \n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t mind him focusing solely on his internal world sometimes - when he\u2019s on the bus or subway, in the bath, when things are slow and boring around the house. That is completely fine. But it becomes a problem when we need to talk to him about something, or when he will barely talk to us for hours at a time or when there is an opportunity for learning and he just ignores it. \n\nWe tried a very small dosage of stimulant briefly when he was 4 with little success. But we could try again to see if that helps. \n\nOne other point I want to make is that it is very all or nothing. I\u2019ve met other kids and adults on the spectrum (or with ADHD) who also seem to  sometimes get lost in thought but it usually is not as dramatic, all-encompassing or long lasting as it is for my son. When he gets into his outward facing, more social, conversational mode, you would never know he can at times be almost completely non-responsive. And the difference between his two \u201cmodes\u201d can actually be very surprising and confusing to people who don\u2019t yet know him very well. For example, one day he will be playing really well with a neighborhood kid, but then next time they see each other he will completely ignore the same kid because he\u2019s focused internally.

He's pretty adept at communicating verbally and his behavior is generally okay. The problem is his reaction to a certain stimulus, usually auditory. This stimulus has changed over the years (it used to be dogs barking, for instance) but since his two-year old brother Kevin was born, it's been him. Basically any time Kevin vocalizes any sort of unhappiness (even a tiny whimper), Brian lashes out at whatever or whomever is in reach. If it's a person, he hits, shoves, pulls hair, bites, or scratches, occasionally to the point of drawing blood. If it's an object, he'll knock it down or throw it, often breaking it in the process.\n\nBrian isn't malicious, he's just extremely upset by the stimulus. We of course don't respond with violence, but in the process of restraining Brian from hurting others or breaking things, I'm sure the restraint can come across as sudden and painful. We also try to keep our emotions in check but I know sometimes the anger we feel is obvious. We don't want to isolate Brian unnecessarily but with two other siblings, remote work, housekeeping, etc sometimes the only viable option seems to be sending him to his room or out in the yard. By all accounts, while his academic progress is slow, his behavior at school is fine, at least not violent or disruptive. We're hoping that as Kevin continues to become more verbal and leaves behind the whiny toddler stage that Brian will be less anxious. But we're also afraid that his outbursts will become harder to manage as he becomes bigger and stronger.\n\nDoes anybody have any suggestions for behavior modification?

She started preschool three weeks ago. It\u2019s a special education program and she has a good IEP. She seemed like she did ok. She doesn\u2019t really have stranger danger, so she did well with being around new people. The only thing her teachers reported her having issues with was transitions, which was expected. She did however immediately got sick within 5 days of starting. We were expecting this too. Everyone warned us about the school germs. She got both Covid and rhinovirus and we ended up pulling her out for just over a week. \n\nAt the same time, she had just graduated out of her early start program and was starting ABA. The paperwork caused a delay in therapy that she was used to getting as part of her routine, so it\u2019s been roughly 5 weeks since she\u2019s had in home therapy as well. \n\nYesterday, she went back to school for the first time again since being sick and it did not go well. The teacher said she cried the entire time except for the last 30 minutes or so. \n\nShe started ABA again today in home (same therapist she\u2019s always had and loves) and it also did not go well. She screamed and cried the entire time. \n\nHer behavior at home has also been much harder than usual. Extremely whiney and sensitive and lots and LOTS of tantrums.

My mental health is shit, my house is shit, I can\u2019t clean like I want to, I can\u2019t get all the laundry done, I don\u2019t want to cook anymore and I love cooking, I probably have depression. I already take pills for anxiety. My daughter has issues with getting on the bus sometimes and the bus driver does not wait at all he\u2019s like if she won\u2019t get on I have to leave, he doesn\u2019t even give it a minute. We didn\u2019t have that issue last year with different drivers. I don\u2019t want to do drop off because we only had one car for a while and I don\u2019t want to get her in the habit of taking the car and I\u2019d have to dress everyone and get them all in and out of car seats plus when she gets on the bus it is babies nap time. Last year went well so idk why this year we\u2019re having issues but I hate the fucking drivers this year. I called the school and cried on the phone\u2026. Yeah\u2026 because we\u2019ve had multiple issues with it and I\u2019m at my breaking point, I\u2019ve posted about it before. The baby is teething and breastfeeds. My daughter is doing so good but she acts like a baby sometimes and whines and I can\u2019t stand it, she\u2019s gotten better at talking and I\u2019m gonna sound like a bitch because she has autism but omg I can\u2019t stand the whining and i think she\u2019s stimming because it\u2019s not a tantrum or when she\u2019s sad. It\u2019s just this noise she makes and I can\u2019t handle it. I love her and I love my life but for like a month I\u2019ve wanted to kill myself and idk why. My husband helps, I get breaks, nothing is really \u201cWrong\u201d but I\u2019m stressed out over EVERYTHING. My breaks are never enough, my husband helping isn\u2019t enough, my mom taking the kids isn\u2019t enough, I just want to quit being a mom for a minute. Idk what\u2019s going on. I love love love my kids and my husband. I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m breaking.

A new woman showed up, isn't taking this seriously despite my having told her that I need him to learn it and I need them to be consistent. \nWhen I asked her if their able to sign with him at school, she casually said that he wasn't signing back and that they were trying to just \"look things up\" on their phones! \nWhat do I do here? \nIdk when the next IEP meeting with HER is and we're on fall break. I think the last teacher took the materials with her when she left the school, and this teacher has nothing for helping kids who really respond better to ASL. \nHe has an IEP and an official diagnosis, he IS hearing and not deaf so I'm not sure what other supports I can get him that will help him at school or where to start? \n\nI'll gladly buy this teacher ASL kids books like the ones we use at home, but not if she's not going to take it seriously and TRY. \n\nSide note: my son didn't start responding to us either in ASL until he figured out howuch it could help him and we insisted more that he don't back. Now he loves it and does it all the time.

If an adult tries speaking to her she cries and hides her eyes or yells \u201cno no!\u201d At them. She does great with other kids though and loves playing with others. When she goes to nursery class at church she does fantastic (even with the teacher). She also will sometimes look down when talking to you and not make eye contact and kinda do a strange shifty eye thing. Other times her eye contact is perfect and will look me straight in the eye when talking. She does some hand flapping but now only when very upset and saying no about something. She is potty trained, communicates really well for the most part, although sometimes still speaks gibberish. Her receptive language is also completely fine. My husband thinks she is perfectly fine and is just shy and sensitive. I just cannot stop being concerned that we are missing something and don\u2019t want to deny her from any services if she needs them.

I have a pediatrician appointment scheduled soon to follow up with my concerns. I would love some community insight to help me get a better view of what I\u2019m looking at in the meantime.\n\nTo start off- I know my son is 2 and a lot of his behaviors can be easily written off as just that. I am not afraid of ASD diagnosis but I want to make the best decision for my kiddo.\n\nThe primary things I notice are:\n\n-obsession with letters, numbers, and colors. He doesn\u2019t just enjoy the alphabet. He studies it. He adds 1+1, 1+2, 2+2, etc. He recites the alphabet all day. He taught himself the alphabet sounds through using tablet games. He is reading 10+ words including ones he sounded out on his own. He likes to carry crayons or color coordinated magnets everywhere. He wants to color 4-6hours a day. Everywhere we go he will list what color shirt a person is wearing before he says hello. I do spend a lot of educational time with him and allow him to watch miss Rachel or use his educational games for fun. I don\u2019t want to discredit his\/my efforts but I feel like his interests are a little more than typical? \n\n-this might seem silly but he only likes to watch miss Rachel, sometimes blues clues, and sometimes Mickey Mouse. He also loves these YouTube videos of cartoon crayons which have little dialogue. He will not entertain any movies for even a few minutes. He won\u2019t watch Disney movies or anything that I feel a 2 year old might want to watch even for a short time. \n\n-he constantly has to touch my mouth to fall asleep at night or if we are relaxing. It\u2019s increasing. Today we were watching tv for a short time and he wanted to touch my mouth\/pull at my lips. It\u2019s so frustrating because it can be aggressive at times. He sleeps in our bed (circumstances don\u2019t allow any other option) and I am starting to wake up to him doing it for comfort. It makes my lips or gums bleed sometimes because he scratches at me if he gets frustrated. It overstimulates me and I feel severely guilty now for how I\u2019ve reacted in the past now that I know it\u2019s likely a sensory benefit. It was cute and sweet when he was a newborn but no matter what we do we can\u2019t seem to break him of it. \n\n-his tantrums are constant. Today he must have had a mini tantrum every 5-10min. Any minor inconvenience he throws his head back and forth and whines loudly. I kept saying he\u2019s two! He\u2019s two! But tonight he started flapping his hands and whining when he couldn\u2019t stick his magnets together. When I looked at him I could see actual stress in his face. He wasn\u2019t just being dramatic. I decided to hold him which painfully I realize I haven\u2019t been doing for these instances because I have chalked it up to him being two. I instantly felt him calm and then he grabbed at my mouth for comfort\/calmjng. I exploded into tears. I felt all my concerns just flooding over me. \n\n-I haven\u2019t been able to break him of the bottle. He would never take a pacifier but instead used his bottle for comfort. I was able to wean him down to one for bed time but trying to wean that one was been a nightmare. We have been trying to lessen the ounces and increase his food in the evenings but nothing is working. Tried cold turkey and that was a disaster. I\u2019m good at holding firm but the screaming in actual distress without his bedtime bottle makes me worried our neighbors will call CPS. \n\n-his social struggles. Being a SAHM I have tried to socialize him the best I can. Sometimes leaving the house is a struggle for him (and me). He sees other kids about once or twice a week for mini soccer or at the playground. He is always so shy. Sometimes says hello if he really really likes a kid. Otherwise he just shuts down. He will try to follow other kids but they get frustrated because he won\u2019t play he just follows them. He has never actually \u201cplayed\u201d with another child. Just played near them. He shows interest but seems like he hits a roadblock when he tries.\n\n-this one is just a random quirk that I don\u2019t think is just a random quirk anymore. He has a \u201csafe\u201d hat and sunglasses. He will wear them indoors. He will wear them as the only one on his soccer team. He seems to feel safe and confident in them. People comment all the time how cute it is. If you try to get him to wear a different hat he will literally melt down. He is now doing this with his clothes and even if I give him options he still panics if it\u2019s new clothing he\u2019s never worn before. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot here but if anyone musters through the novel I appreciate you and your opinion.

He's been getting ABA therapy at home 3hrs a day 5 days a week and I have seen major improvements in his skills and speech, they also helped with potty training, he is not 100% trained yet but we hope by the end of this year he has it down. His BCBA let us know that there is a high possibility he will be able to graduate ABA sometime next year. He struggles a lot with emotional regulation. He does OT & Speech 1x a week as well. \n\nRecently (about two weeks ago) we had the opportunity to enroll him at our local preschool program, even though school started back in August. At first, I thought this would be a great idea because I do believe he needs that social interaction with kids his age (he's the only child & we have family but the youngest is 7). I let them know ahead of time about his dx and all they told me was to bring in his evals from speech, OT & his autism dx. Everything was going great, until they skimmed through all of his paperwork. Here comes Case Worker, Social Worker, Teacher all skimming through his paperwork. They tell me that he automatically qualifies for an IEP which I was aware of, BUT there were some complications since he was 3 (soon to be 4 in Dec) according to the district (we live in a large city), the school district's assessment team would have to asses him since he was 3. If he was already 4 they would be able to enroll him and have the team at the school asses him. I let them know I had previously tried to get that done earlier in the year but no one ever followed up. The case worker gave me the information to the head of the city's diverse learners department, i did, she reached back out and said they can go ahead and proceed with the assessment at the school. \n\n\nI was excited but nervous about this, I called the office to let them know I had received the OK to have him assessed by their team. The lady that I spoke to seemed to almost want to talk me out of it - she mentioned that it was a process and he would be placed in a general class before they could even have the assessment done which could take a few weeks. That scared me a bit. She finished by saying \"but I'm not the case worker so talk to her about the process I'm just telling you from my understanding\". After that call the caseworker called me and left me a VM , very welcoming, letting me know to call the main office and to enroll him and she should be able to pull all of his information in the next two days and we can go from there. \n\nI'm at odds here. It was not a great first impression, from the adminitrative side at least. My husband as well as all my younger siblings were enrolled in this same school and there were no complaints. However, they were all mainstream. I feel like this would be one of the only chances I get at having an IEP written up for my son, since our city is in a huge deficit when it comes to funding for education and I'm sure my chances at getting him assessed by the city team soon are slim. The applications for next school year are due on November 15th. Can someone please give me some input on this? \n\nThank you!

She admitted to these back when she was 9 but this is the first time she's done it with us around.\n\nDuring the ER stint, the attending psych actually asked us if there had ever been talk of her being autistic.

He started at a Montessori preschool at the beginning of September and his behavior at home has become quite rude recently.\n\nI'll walk through last night. We get in the car, he tells me he would like a snack, and I give him one graham crackers from the car supply. He asks for another about 5 mins from home. I tell him that he can have more once we're home. He screams \"no that's not the answer\" and tells me \"I'm mad.\" I respond - \"I'm sorry you're upset. You can have another snack at home.\" We get home. Everyday he rushes me through getting settled to get what he wants (i.e. letting out the dog, taking off my shoes, getting his younger sister situated with a toy, etc.) That's fine, my narrative is always the same - okay baby, give me a moment. Please wait. Yesterday, after the third time he asked me something and I responded, he stormed off and slammed his bedroom door. I gave him 1 min, opened the door, and politely but firmly said \"we do not slam doors in this house. You will now need to wait longer for what you want. I need to see that you can act kindly towards me.\" He calms down, even comes to the kitchen to tell me he loves me and give me a hug. I let him watch some number blocks while I make dinner. I tell him dinner is ready. He tells me \"that makes me mad,\" stomps his foot dramatically, then goes into his room and closes the door (without slamming it, at least). I give him a moment. Open the door and invite him to dinner. He tells me \"that makes me mad\" and I offer that finishing dinner means he can have strawberries. He eventually comes out. He proceeds to yell \"no,\" shout frustrations at his sister whenever she babbles, tell my husband and I to stop talking, smack his elbow on the table in place of stomping, and generally refuse all interventions (i.e. noise cancelling headphones or taking a break). Bedtime is filled with the same energy. \n\nLast night is very much like almost every night the last 2-3 weeks. He is level 1. Speech delayed. In speech and OT weekly. He actually got in trouble with them yesterday morning for similar behavior. No one in our home stomps, shouts no, or slams door. His former nanny's son does apparently slam doors from time to time. I theorize that he is overstimulated from preschool and just doesn't know how to stop once we hit the evenings but I have no idea what to do if he won't take any of the options to help regulate (i.e. weighted blanket, deep breaths, time in his room, etc.). I say the following a lot - \"thank you for telling me how you feel. It's okay to be mad, but it is not okay to be mean. Mad is a feeling. Mean like slamming doors or yelling at me are actions\/behaviors.\" I think I said this 10x last night and I know it's ineffective because verbal language does not seem to be the best method for him - especially when in a dysregulated space. \n\nWe are patient and calm with him as much as we can possibly be. Sometimes the tone definitely gets a bit sharper after the 7th time we've asked him not to yell at his sister because she just babbling like an 18 Mon old. I just don't know how to discipline or change this behavior in a manner that will be productive and not harmful for him. It seems like he just hasn't grasped that his behavior might affect others negatively and he'll pop up and give me love and be sweet or ask for things like 2 mins after we've had yet another talk about taking breaths and counting down from 5 and not shouting at me because it takes me 10 seconds too long to do something.

Last year when she started Pre K it was tough but I pushed and got her diagnosed and it finally felt like we were making some progress toward the end of the year. \n\nI knew things were going to be rough for a bit as she always has had difficulty with transitioning so I try to keep to a very normal schedule. I was hoping returning to the same school even with a different teacher would be helpful. \n\nShe started eloping last year and at first I was like oh my gosh she\u2019s having them chase her through the school not funny but kind of silly but as it continued and she began exhibiting unsafe behaviors and leaving class longer and longer I became much more concerned. Her teacher and the behavioral staff were able to push to be all on the same page we made changes to her iep for what they are allowed to do in certain situations and she stopped eloping. \n\nThis year has been constant since day one she\u2019s been out of her classroom. I\u2019m having principals messaging me letting me know they were the one who chased her through the hallways today. She\u2019s missing hours of class time and this past week has started taking to eloping outside the building which really scares the heck out of me. \n\nI know there is only so little they can do as far as they can stand in her way and block her but can\u2019t touch her or drag her back to class but I\u2019m completely powerless to control anything she\u2019s doing after I put her on that bus and I hate that feeling. She\u2019s my child she\u2019s an extension of me and she wouldn\u2019t try these things with me either. \n\nAt home I\u2019ve been super responsive to all of their communications, sent in suggestions of what works at home, shared things that I am using as a punishment at home (mainly taking away electronics) or things that I\u2019m using as a reward (going to a specific place she enjoys going ) so they can reiterate that at school and have daily talks with her about these reports that I\u2019ve been receiving. \n\nEvery morning on our way to daycare we talk about what we\u2019re going to do today and the only thing I\u2019m focusing on is staying with her class\/teacher. Obviously I want her in there and on task but too many directives at once loses the message for her. \n\nIn the 60 iep check in we discussed some things that they were trying\u2014they switched her out of gym to art and her teacher comes to get her in from recess separate from her class as those were times when she was eloping the most. I was shocked to learn she had only been in her afternoon classes for the full class 3 days out of the first 60 days at school. She\u2019s running miles around the building and is exhausted when she gets home usually passing out in the car in the 2 minutes it takes to get to our house. \n\nShe\u2019s falling behind, unable or unwilling to do things she was able to do at the end of last year and these are important things, reading and math are only going to get more difficult as we go on. \n\nWe work with her abh therapist and are on the waiting list for occupational therapy referrals but I am so discouraged. I never say \u201c what\u2019s wrong with you\u201dbecause my mother did that to me and it left me feeling inadequate and unloved as a child but I just don\u2019t understand why she keeps running and acting like this. When I ask why I don\u2019t get any answer or just because.  \n\nYesterdays report said she was knocking over a rocking chair, yelling and had eloped outside at least three times. That is something that absolutely would not fly at home, and I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s her observing some other children\u2019s behaviors and mimicking. She\u2019s got echolalia but I don\u2019t think that would have anything to do with it. \n\nI\u2019ve reached out to family, her therapist, the teachers and feel as if I\u2019m screaming into the void here but thought I\u2019d give this a try.

Decreased babbling, waving, imitation, name response: it's all still there but it's less frequent overall, or it ebbs and flows. He doesn't clap, point or speak, never did. Sometimes follows my index finger, sometimes just looks at it. Demonstrates some joint attention when playing with something together, but this too isn't frequent. Seems like he seeks novelty for social engagement: we're a bilingual household but use one language less frequently, and we recently noticed that speaking in that language is more likely to grab his attention than speaking in our \"main\" language. He smiles at faces of cartoon characters often, but also has social smiles (less frequently but it's there), and enjoys peek a boo almost every time, but grabbing his attention for it is the challenge.\n\nHe walks in the room, I call him, he ignores me 9 times out of 10.

Because she LOOKS neurotypical, they say she needs to be with them. Her therapies were 45 minutes a week. That was not enough time to get to know her. \n\nShe has a nurse because she is unable to sweat and regulate her body temperature. This nurse also assists in other ways. \n\nToday I received a message from her teacher she was struggling to focus and listen to directions. I told them this was an issues 100x. I told them to look past what they see and observe her struggles. They insisted she was fine. Now she isn't. Her nurse told me she's a great kid, very smart and kind. She said she just can't sit still and focus. \n\nI asked her if it was like she tried and then loses focus because her brain goes to something else? She said yes. We have taught our daughter to tell us her brain is going too fast when it feels that way. She says it more and more. \n\nThe nurse says she can tell our daughter isn't paying attention maliciously.

He's been having a hard time at school especially, and after a particularly rough day his teacher recommended setting him up for an autism screening, as he reminded her of her own son who was diagnosed with autism. \n\nFor the first few days, his mom convinced herself that he must have ADHD and not autism, because he's \"too affectionate\" to be autistic. He has an evaluation scheduled now thankfully, but in the meantime she has really been looking into some things that are really concerning to me. For one thing, she is a mom who is really into natruopathic\/herbal medicine and remedies. Obviously that's fine on its own, but lately she has started giving him some kind of sugar pills to \"help his emotional regulation\"? and on top of that, she has started him on a completely gluten and refined sugar free diet because she read somewhere online that apparently those things are really bad for the brains of neurodivergent children. This kid is three years old and she has him on a crazy diet because of a neurodivergency that isn't even confirmed yet.\n\n The worst of it all is that today she told me essentially that she had found an organization thing online that uses science and therapies to \"fix\" basically anything \"wrong\" with the brains of children, from TBIs and fetal alcohol syndrome to ADHD and autism. I looked at their website and it is so clearly an incredibly predatory organization that is looking to prey on parents who are scared for their kids' future. They bait parents in by preying on their love for their children, hook them with a few hours of \"free educational content\" and then have them pay hundreds of dollars for courses on how to \"heal their children\". She is already watching these videos and saying how amazing it is that they can fix all of these issues. It's really bad and honestly almost cultlike. It's bad enough that I am reluctant to say the name of it in this post because I don't want to direct people to it and cause anyone else to get caught up in their scam.\n\nObviously this is really not great. For one thing, I think it's really important that she understands that autism and disability in general is not something evil that needs to be \"fixed.\" I don't want this kid to grow up thinking that there's something terrible and wrong with him that makes him different and bad, but this is very clearly what his future holds if his mom keeps going like this. And obviously another thing is that I don't want the mom to fall into this trap of paying thousands of dollars to be scammed by someone who has nothing but bad intentions. I completely understand that she is freaked out and only wants the best for her son, but this is absolutely not the way to help him. \n\nI wanted to post to this subreddit to hopefully get some advice and perspective on this situation from people who have kids with autism. I am not a parent, nor do I ever intend on being one, and I am worried that if I try to give her input on what she is doing, she will either not take me seriously because I'm a 21 year old college student who doesn't know what she's talking about, or she will take it as an attack on her parenting. I've already reached out to one of my professors who specializes in special education for kids with autism, but I am hoping to get perspectives from people who have personal experience with this kind of thing. \n\nAnyways, that's about it. Thank you so much for reading this far. I would so deeply appreciate any kind of guidance or outside perspective on this situation.

However, there's a little situation at the moment, it's been found out that some kids from the class were assaulting \"multiple\" girls in different occasions last year. They went to the toilets in a group, took a girl in, asked her to take of her pants. Not a word was said, apart from the parents of those who took part on what happened.\n\nCue to this year, it's happening again. The victim told their parents, and they told everyone, so all the parents in the class found out. Thing is, a few days before we've had our annual meeting, and they said out loud \"bullying protocols\" were \"not important\" at this point as the school were applying them. The teacher knew at that point this was happening, tho.\n\nNow, some parents of the class (me included) are asking for another meeting, as we want the school to explain what the hell are they doing. What kind of measures are they \"applying\" (none, as far as I understand, as it's happened twice), etc. I feel my son is unprotected, as he's autistic and doesn't understand what's goind on, BUT he does understand something bad is happening: the other day came home saying victim 2 was \"sad\" and \"crying\" so he went and hug them.\n\nThe problem: my husband. Ok, he's still somehow in denial our kid's autistic (diagnosed three years ago), but he doesn't see a problem in this situation. He doesn't see the need of asking for a meeting at school, he says we are \"exaggerating\", calling us crazy. When I brought up my son is kind of 'friends' with one of the kids who is one of the abusers, he just disregarded me.\n\nWhat would you do?

He received a medical diagnosis of ASD at age 5. His current Individualized Education Program (IEP) addresses ASD and language impairment. He underwent one year of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy for two hours daily. Since preschool, he has been receiving speech-language therapy (SLT) and occupational therapy (OT) through school. He participates in social skills lessons and starts his mornings gently with his special education teacher in the resource room before joining the general education classroom for most of the day. He had an aide from kindergarten to 2nd grade, but it was decided before 3rd grade that he no longer needed one, and the transition has been successful.\n\nAcademically, he excels in all subjects. At the start-of-year assessments, he was reading at a 4th-grade level and tested at a mid-4th-grade level in math, surpassing most of his 4th-grade peers in our district. His main challenge is his high competitiveness in academics. He has had issues with outbursts in class, impatience when he knows answers that others don't, and making faces and noises when peers answer incorrectly. Although he is now more easily redirected and the frequency of these incidents has decreased, they still occur daily.\n\nYesterday, I attended the annual case review (ACR) meeting for my son with the IEP team. The speech-language therapist (SLT) suggested a reevaluation for service eligibility, which I supported due to his significantly improved language skills. She believes he is ready for consultation services, allowing her to check in with his teachers quarterly. The occupational therapist (OT) also recommended a shift to consultation services since he has achieved his fine motor goals. I agreed with this proposal. However, the special education (SPED) teacher and the IEP specialist raised the possibility of reevaluating his ASD status in the educational context. His academic success has greatly diminished the educational impact of his ASD. Losing the ASD designation would mean forfeiting access to the resource room, which supports his social skills development and provides a soft start to his day. As he nears puberty, I am reluctant to remove this support due to potential regressions. Part of me wonders if a more 'typical' school experience would be beneficial for him, without the extra assistance.\n\nMy husband believes we should defer reevaluation until he transitions to middle school. I tend to agree, given the uncertainties of puberty. Yet, 'mom guilt' persists, leaving me torn between potentially limiting his progress by continuing unnecessary services and risking regression if those services are withdrawn. Does anyone have any experience with this issue or suggestions I'm not considering?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1g5sxr6\/iep_team_suggested_at_acr_that_we_reevaluate_to\/","main_id":"1g5sxr6","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-17 15:01:27"}

He receives Speech, occupational, and physical therapies at a developmental daycare and we have him on the waiting list to see an Autism specialist for diagnosis (10 months average left of the 16 month wait).

She was in ABA therapy throughout kindergarten and we took her out at the beginning of first grade this year. Since the beginning of Kindergarten she has been on Focalin for her ADHD because she would have trouble focusing in school and without it she would essentially be impossible for her teachers to deal with.\n\nWe just had our first parent\/teacher meeting with her First grade teacher. She had mentioned that she loves my daughters personality and really feels like she has made a connection with my daughter, which is great. However, she mentioned that over the last few weeks my daughters ability to focus in class has degraded quite a bit. She showed us a composition book where students are supposed to write sentences about certain things about them and my daughters book was full of pictures. We had actually even noticed that my daughter had a lot of drawings all over worksheets the teacher would send home as well. Her teacher is aware that she takes ADHD medication. We let the teacher know that in the beginning we were trying to find the right dosage for my daughter and at one point the dosage was too high and would make my daughter quiet and almost catatonic. We dialed in that dosage last year and found what worked. The other issue is that the medication essentially kills my daughters appetite and she doesn't eat a whole lot, which is another concern (she has been getting better with eating more and was on a different medication to help with her appetite). The teacher expressed that she doesn't think increasing her dosage is the right move because she doesn't want to kill my daughters creativity and personality. My wife agrees with this and is also worried about it negatively affecting my daughters appetite even more. I, on the other hand, think maybe we can try a slightly higher dosage to help with reeling in her focus since that is why she takes the medication in the first place. I understand my the point of view of my wife and the teacher. I am actually seeing my daughters pediatrician tomorrow to discuss this more in depth with them. This honestly just ended with an argument between my wife and I about what is best for our daughter.\n\nI just wanted to see if anyone here has dealt with any sort of similar issues?

Last time I came her for some advice you guys were a literally life saver and I desperately need you all right now! \n\nOk so a bit of backstory, my son is 6 and is diagnosed AuDHD, ODD, DMDD and we also believe he has PDA and will discuss that when we see his doctor again. So ever since my son started school back in 2020 he's struggled. The school he went to started sending him home on the first day and never gave him a chance. Even after his diagnosis and getting extra support. I didn't know how till I posted on here and got a new BC that I even found out theyre not supposed to do that. Just to add my son had minor behaviors at this point I'm time and mainly was eloping and having issues with concentration. \n\nFast forward we are in first grade now. K wasn't much direrent and they started sending him home at half a day for most of the year and eventually did get him back on full days and he's finished out the year strong and even did great in ESY. We're two months into the school year and he's already been suspended 4 times once for an entire week.\n\nHe's refusing to do his work, refusing to sit and eloping from the classroom, being aggressive toward staff, being loud and intimidating to other classmates and saying some very very nasty things! Making threats like \"blowing up the school\". I'm mortified! We've had countless IEP meetings, worked on punishments and reward systems but it's not getting better. Now me and his bc believe the main reason for the behaviors is he is trying to be sent home. From the moment he walks through the door his #1 goal is to go home and he will do anything and everything to reach that goal. \n\nI'm sympathetic for the staff and other kids. I have a daughter as well that is he upset if a child in her class behaved like that.. but I don't know what to do?! We tried to get him into a partial hospitalization program and he was added to a waiting list which was so disheartening because it would've been such an amazing fit for him. The school seems to be out of options? They asked if I'd just homeschool him. We're not local to family and I really don't wanna take him out cause he needs to be around other kids more often but also I just wanna make sure he succeeds and I'm mentally drained and am afraid I won't be able to keep him up to date and on task. I have AuDHD myself and struggle as well. \n\nSo my question for you guys is what do you recommend. I've reached out to an advocate but she's so hard to get into contact with. She attended the last IEP meeting and told me if he wasn't accepted into the partial I needed to get him out of that school cause they're failing him. Should I stick it out and see how the rest of the year goes? Homeschool him? Stick him into another school? \n\nI wanna help him so bad. He's struggling and does so much better in small settings and they can't seem to offer that.

(This is long bc it just feels like I've been holding things in). This is mostly venting but I'm open to any advice or she's experiences. \n\nMy daughter is 4yrs old, diagnosed with autism 2 yrs ago, Dr believes possible adhd but wants to hold off on diagnosing too early.  I suspect we're also dealing with some PDA. She was non-verbal until 2 1\/2 yrs old. \n\nWe've had issues in prek and daycare with aggression, but we've had some improvement (with constant redirecting). I've really been wanting to get her into some kind of activity,  but didn't want to go with team sports that forced even more interaction on her (like soccer), especially since she really does thing on her own time (example: we can try to get her to do something,  but only once we\/ the teachers back off will she decide on her own to do that thing). \n\n2 weeks ago I came across a local martial arts academy that was offering 1 month free and thought it was worth a try. So this week,  she had an introductory 1:1 class. She saw another girl her age and she got very excited to do the same things. She gets on the floor and was learning blocking, she was having fun,  but I could see sure was distracted (she kept looking around at everything,  watching other kids who were with other teachers, etc) and I was getting a weird vibe from her teacher (not bad, just like she felt uncomfortable\/ didn't have experience working with such a young child). After 10 mins the teacher brought her to me saying she needed a mommy break.  I got some hugs,  but this is when it kind of went downhill.  \n\nOne challenge we're working on in language therapy is communicating feelings.  She goes through what I call \"everything is no\". It doesn't matter what she's asked\/told,  her only response is yelling no. Usually if we're not on someone else's schedule,  I can sit with her quietly for a few mins or distract her with my phone,  or tickles,  or whatever until she decides she's OK and ready to continue but this day we didn't have that time bc other kids were coming in for their scheduled times. One minute she was ready to go back out and continue,  the next minute not. Eventually I had to carry her out screaming and ask to reschedule.  \n\nI had originally asked for the 1:1 bc I thought having her in a group might be overwhelming, but the teacher suggested she might do better with a class. I'm just not sure- i THINK seeing other kids seeing an example might be good for her,  but I don't know. Another part of me wants to ask to go on the floor with her next time to help keep her focused, but I don't know if that is enabling (maybe the wrong choice of word, not sure) or hindering her from being independent.  Or maybe requesting if she can be paired with one other student at her level,  like a buddy.  Maybe looking for input\/ suggestions.  \n\nBut ultimately everytime we try something new, I feel like a failure as a parent.  Am i raising a brat? Have I been too lenient and given her her way in too many \"Battles\"? \n\nPiggybacking on this- one of the parents of her daycare classmates is an RBT. We were at a party recently and she told me how she \"aba'd\" my daughter the other day at daycare.  I of course was confused bc we never did aba and when she explained what she did,  it was essentially trying to help my daughter understand\/ communicate how she was feeling (I am not upset that she did this) however she had assumed we had done aba therapy.  She was shocked when i explained that we hadn't.  I think many of us already feel judged by other parents,  and this made me feel even more so bc it was like I felt like I looked like a crap parent bc I must not have been practicing what we should have learned and I've allowed this continued behavior- but now i just look like a crap parent bc I didn't have the money to do aba (insurance wouldn't cover until we paid our full deductible). I'm sure with my new insurance we could do it but she's already in prek 5 days a week through the school system + after-school daycare.  \n\n\n\n ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1g665bg\/tried_karate_and_it_felt_futile\/","main_id":"1g665bg","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-18 00:54:13"}

I could tell pretty early in the day that it was going to be a rough one. I basically just checked on him in his room every now and then. Brought him some food and fluids, he genuinely seemed offended by my presence and was just all cuddled up in his blanket rocking. Shortly after lunch he was crying, I checked his temp and it was fine. Made sure all needs were met but it didn\u2019t seem to help- it was more of a sad cry. I thought why not put him in the tub since he loves being in there and it usually solves all the problems temporarily. He was having a great time, I usually let him splash around and I pull the shower curtain and sit on the toilet and watch him. He started rocking a little bit which is really not unusual and then in a blink of an eye he put his whole head under water (which he never ever does in the tub, in pools we have to hold him because he will try to put his face in the water but never in the tub.) and it was like he was screaming under there and was panicking but not able to get himself back up. I\u2019m telling you, I reacted as quick as I could. I was absolutely shocked at what happened. What I saw and heard, I am traumatized. Obviously when I pulled him out he was still panicked and was attempting to hurt me which I don\u2019t take personally at all, I made sure he had a diaper on and he curled up in my blanket on the bed. I called my husband to come home because I was an absolute wreck, my crying wasn\u2019t helping my son at all so I kept it in as much as I could until my husband got home. I have no idea if he inhaled any water but I will for sure monitor for any signs of respiratory issues. Now that I have had some time to reflect I realize it could have been REALLY bad. We never leave our son unattended near any water, but I was right there and something awful happened anyways. My heart hurts, I feel like this will keep replaying over and over in my head.

I can deal with that bc I see the cause and then try to empathize with his internal struggles. \n\nWhat idk about and kind of bothers me is, his mean spirit towards others at times. Namely, his older brother. My oldest is a teen. He loves his little brother. He treats him great and my little one loves spending time with the older one. BUT he speaks very ugly to him. My little tells my older, \"I hate you.\" Even when my older says, \"I love you.\" He still looks at him and says, \"Well I hate you.\" I was leaning towards him finding this funny bc they do a lot of brotherly teasing.

One of my stepdaughters is 11 and diagnosed Level 1 as well as ADHD and anxiety. She has been on medication and in therapy since she was four- she is also seen by several specialists for chronic constipation. She sees an OT, a talk therapist, her guidance counselor, and adjustment counselor, and attends equine therapy. She has an IEP to help her with bathroom issues, sensitivity, and math. I say all this just to say she is very supported and both my husband and his ex wife (and I) are educated on autism, triggers, etc.\n\nThe problem is just that she\u2019s\u2026you know, entering middle school and has ASD. She is super sweet but also very young for her age. She is that kid still wearing matching outfits (like foxes on her tights with a fox skirt and a fox on her shirt) and wears her tails\/ears to school regularly. She always wants to play games where she is a baby animal found in the woods who has to be taught to eat, potty, etc. She also struggles with other normal kid behavior that some of her peers have grown out of- she doesn\u2019t like to bathe and resists it so can smell kind of ripe, she is constantly picking at her her privates (I tell her literally a dozen times a day to get her hands out of her pants and so does her mom), she tattles if other kids won\u2019t play imagination with her, etc. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong- I don\u2019t really care if she wants to wear matching outfits and fox ears. I don\u2019t really care if she always wants to be a baby bunny! Let your freak flag fly kid! The problem is that the other kids are rejecting her and she has no idea why. She often comes to me crying since school started saying other kids have stopped playing with her and call her weird. The school says they can\u2019t force kids to play together and it isn\u2019t considered bullying so they aren\u2019t doing much. Other kids have called her a baby, said she is annoying, said she\u2019s gross, etc. Part of me wants to tell her that she might want to consider leaving the ears and tails at home if she doesn\u2019t want to draw the attention of bullies\u2026but then part of me wants to avoid saying anything that bc it might further damage her self esteem. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do to help. When I was her age I was a super weird kid but I also knew I\u2019d get negative attention for it from popular kids. I KNEW and understood kids though it was weird when I wore a cheetah print purple sweatsuit complete with cheetah ears but I was obnoxious and loud and invited that kind of interaction. My stepdaughter is NOT like that. She is desperate to be accepted and popular and does not seem to understand that she\u2019ll be judged harshly by the other kids. She has also started becoming very aware that she\u2019s one of very few kids who are taken out of the classroom regularly for various therapies and doctor visits and has started resisting the intervention services.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Is this just part of parenting and growing up? She is so funny and sweet and sensitive and it just seems like every day at school is a disappointment for her.

For context, our parents were pretty bad parents growing up. They moved from a traumatised country that I won't disclose, but our traditional culture and generational trauma has really added icing to the cake of bullshit that we've had to endure. They weren't equipped to deal with everything they dealt with and moved to Australia for a better life but all they did was suffer and there was a lot of resentment and shame because of it. \nMy mother was physically abusive but only to me, because I didn't have aspergers so she could abuse me with a clear conscience. And my dad was a typical dad from our culture- not present. He went to work and paid the bills, and for the most part wasn't really involved until shit started hitting the fan with my sister and my mother wasn't mentally stable enough to handle that.\nBut I digress, I moved out at 19 and my parents finally divorced in my early twenties and it's better for everyone. \nMy sister lives with my dad and to be very to the point, isn't a nice person. She was never really nice growing up either, there were instances where she would tell my mother to hit me because she was angry at me. She was abusive in her own way and now as an adult she's better but still not quite a nice person. \nShe's very judgemental, mean, dramatic and over sensitive. She also has a very high level of anxiety which impacts her ability to walk. She limps everywhere and at this point can barely walk from one side of the house to the other.\nShe lives with my father because my mother (who has her own list of issues a mile long) can't deal with her. At one point she kicked my sister out of her house because she couldn't stand listening to her complain and provoke her. \nMy sister has tried a number of different medication for anxiety and sees a psychiatrist but the problem never actually gets better. \nMy main concern now is my dad who is really the only one capable of taking care of her full time. He's getting old both physically and mentally. He is being verbally and emotionally abused by my sister every day and seems like he's never known peace a day in his life. I used to resent him for my childhood but he's a completely different person than who he was when I was growing up. My entire childhood it was like he was angry for having to deal with my sister, my own trauma and my mother. Now, he's like a zombie and I feel like I made it out of the abusive home but he will die in it because he has no choice. \nI don't know if I'm writing this all out to just get my emotions out or to ask for advice. I don't know what type of advice people can give me. She's already been on a bunch of different medications for anxiety- but it feels like her brain doesn't want to let the medication do its job. It feels weird and guilty but I have no other way of explaining it other than she's just really not a nice person and I don't think she wants to be. \nIs there anything anyone can recommend or any words of wisdom for this situation?

Every day.\n\nI realized immediately that there is absolutely no way. On good days we could manage 100 grams. \n\nThis meant on 95% of days he didn\u2019t even reach half of recommended intake. And there is 0 iron in breast milk mind you.\n\nAfter a while I realized there is a whole lot more iron in \u201dblood food\u201d, I don\u2019t know the correct saying. It was a couple of weeks after we introduced that to him that he actually said his first words (again) at 18 months. He had actually regressed before that, dropping the 3 words he used to have. Now he is great though.\n\nI just think it\u2019s weird no one tells you that there is absolutely no way to meet recommended iron intake unless your 1 year old actually eats like an grown adult, unless you give them \u201dblood food\u201d. \n\nBreast milk contains very, very little iron and after 6 months, babies need an external, natural source of iron:\nhttps:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/breastfeeding-special-circumstances\/hcp\/diet-micronutrients\/iron.html\n\nIron from non-meat sources have low bioavailability: (about 5% vs heme-iron, or \u201dmeat iron\u201d about 27%)\n\nhttps:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC6567869\/\n\nSince \u201dfortified foods\u201d contains non heme-iron, they are basically not fortified. Especially if consumed with calcium.\n\n\nHas anyone here thought about this?\n\nRegards! And please do not engage in giving your kids an  iron overdose using supplements, which can actually be deadly. The body cannot rid itself of excess iron. And supplements as a group use a low bio availability form of iron. Get them heme-iron instead if you are concerned.\n","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1g6r1m1\/iron_deficiency_and_autism\/","main_id":"1g6r1m1","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-18 19:50:59"}

He can say sentences and words but it's moreso the articulating the first letter of words and sometims L's or Ss in middle of words(shark is ark, sit is it, police officer is police ovviver, etc.)\n\nI had a feeling about autism since he turned 3. He had frequent meltdowns which worsened with age. He particularly got upset when his toys fell over, wouldn't stand a certain way, or couldn't stand at all. He started lining up toys when he was around 2.5 years old and still does to this day.\n\nHe also did some mild hand flapping when he was excited or frustrated. He is\/was a HUGE mommy's boy and clings to me constantly. If we go to a play ground, he will either have me join him play or sometimes play by himself. He would not go other kids to play. We went to a few birthday parties and he knew the kids, but was too shy to play with them\/other friends and still clung to me.\n\nHe is fixated in dinosaurs, partially Trex and carnivore dinosaurs.

He did well with the offered supports in the program and they tried to add more inclusion to challenge him, he didn\u2019t need additional OP, did require ST as he\u2019s considered non verbal tho he does use verbal communication, he\u2019s gestalt language processor in stage 2 or 3. He has no Fba or Bip. He\u2019s not agressive, no tantrums, he\u2019s happy and sings songs a lot. He can read, he can do math, he traces letters, he makes cool art, he is doing incredibly well in specials too! \n\nhowever he is lacking in focus and needs a lot of instructional support to get him to perform tasks on demand. \n\nHe is inclusion with a 1:1 RBT but she\u2019s assigned to him part of day as the aid will rotate throughout the day. The call it 1:1 adult support. This rbt was specifically hired as she\u2019s trained in the learning he\u2019s used to from his aba pre-k. \n\nThe special Ed teacher has lost my son twice but he is required to have an aid in arms reach at all times, he is an opportunistic Bolter who shows no signs of distress before he will elope or wander or bolt.  He just goes to art class or the library but everytime they do thoroughly review tape footage say he\u2019s in no distress just looking around.  \n\nShe denies breaking iep of course said both occasions are due to emergencies with other peers. \n\nHis special Ed teacher says she\u2019s in charge of instructional control and he\u2019s not producing as capable with the way she provides instruction. Said he needs to go to the aba special education district programs which are programs not on track to graduate so they don\u2019t have to focus on academic goals presay tho some students works towards transitioning to some academic goals. \n\nThe team thinks that\u2019s a passive way to dismiss my son\u2019s potential and said they hired an RBT for this reason. \n\nThe special Ed teacher argues she\u2019s required to provide instruction and if the rbt did she would technically be his teacher or something. \n\nI just want to be like, teacher this isn\u2019t about you! \n\nHe loves being included! He loves school, he just started adjusting to the bus. He would be devastated to leave and we would lose a lot of the modeling and observant opportunities that seem to help him grow most. \n\nThe principal was mad that our choice is to have a series of review days for more data with specialists. He kept saying that his teacher is going on maternity leave so it will skew the data. Honestly, A Sub could make a positive difference tho\u2026Because his teacher seriously finds my son too challenging. \n\nThe aba program doesn\u2019t think their environment will be right for him as it may not be challenging enough, most the kids have BIP\u2019s and he doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s sort of focused on kids with similar support needs and these intervention plans. \n\nI love our home school and want him to stay but it\u2019s disheartening they want to push him out. His brother is going there and I grew up here and went there too. \n\nI\u2019m glad we are gathering more data and I hope he does well with the sun because then it\u2019ll be obvious the teacher was part of the problem.\n\nAlso what\u2019s with not letting the RBT help my son access her information instruction in the aba way or whatever? I don\u2019t get that at all! \n\nHe didn\u2019t focus long enough to complete dibels but he did well for the material he could focus on. He is showing progress but kindergarten has been a huge transition! He\u2019s just now getting more comfortable. I think he needs a chance! \n\nAlso..

I wasn't surprised by the news, in fact it was nice to get an actual diagnosis so I could try to get him the resources he needed. He is low needs and has a very high IQ so it's very difficult for him in public situations where we get a lot of \"but he doesn't seem autistic\" comments.\n\nShortly after his diagnosis, my wife self diagnosed as autistic also. \n\nI love them both deeply, so I delved into the world of Neurodiverse to try and educate myself more on a subject that I was ignorant of before. \n\nBut over time, my wife has seemed to have created this environment in our house of \"Neurotypicals Vs Neurodiverse people\". For example my wife regularly complains in front of our son that his teachers don't get him or understand him because they are \"Neurotypicals\". Anyone she doesn't like or any behaviour she doesn't agree with is blamed on Neurotypicals.\n\nMy son now has this mentality too. To the point that he will not let me comfort him anymore when he is upset because \"I am a Neurotypical so I don't understand.\" Before, I was the go to person for him for comfort.

{"post_type":"s","created_utc":1729358110.0,"subreddit":"Autism_Parenting","author":"Minute-Instruction-4","link_flair":"Advice Needed","title":"Is my son Autistic?","selftext":"Assessment Information\nPlay and Behavioral Observations\nMiles was evaluated at ABCSpeak in a quiet therapy room. He transitioned fairly easily into\nthe evaluation process. His father accompanied him into the room but remained in the waiting\nroom during testing measures. Miles presented as a curious, active and sweet boy. He had\nrelative difficulty attending to a toy or object for an extended amount of time and was observed to\nmove around the room. Miles was able to engage in diagnostic tasks given frequent\nredirection, using a \u201cfirst-then\u201d approach as well as use of a positive reinforcement schedule (e.g.,\nlet\u2019s look at 2 pictures and then you get the popper). He showed interest in toys and objects both\nwithin and out of reach. His play was mostly limited and self-directed. Similarly, he was resistant to\nattempts to play with this evaluator, moving onto a new toy or object when this happened.\nMiles communicated for different purposes, such as asking for help, negating\/protesting,\nexclaiming, naming\/labeling and directing attention. He was mostly quiet during play but was\nobserved to occasionally use language appropriately (e.g., a small train; I want the black car; I go\nagain). He also demonstrated immediate echolalia, or the repetition of spoken words by others\n(e.g., let\u2019s come in here).\nLanguage\nThe Preschool Language Scale - 5 was administered to assess Abraham\u2019s language production\nand comprehension skills. Standard scores between 85 - 115 are considered to be within the\naverage range, with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15.\n \nStandard Score\nPercentile Rank\n \nAuditory Comprehension\n \n78\n \n7\n \nScores fall below\nthe average\nExpressive Communication\n84\n14\nScores fall below\nthe average range\nTotal Language Score\n80\n9\nScores fall below\nthe average range\n \nReceptive Language\nThe Auditory Comprehension subtest of the PLS-5 assesses how much language is understood.\nMiles received a standard score of 78, which falls below the low average range (7th percentile\nrank). Miles was able to understand spatial concepts (in, out of, off) without gestural cues,\nmake inferences (look at these pictures, how do you think Charlie\u2019s shoes got wet?) and identify\ncolors. At times, Miles benefitted from redirection to the task and repetition of directions.\nExpressive Language\nThe Expressive Communication subtest of the PLS-5 assesses how well someone communicates\nwith others. Miles received a standard score of 84 (14th percentile rank), which falls below the\naverage range. He was able to name a variety of pictured objects (e.g., teddy bear, scissors,\nbanana, elephant), combine 3 or 4 words in spontaneous speech, use a variety of nouns, verbs,\nmodifiers and pronouns in spontaneous speech, produce 4 and 5 word sentences, use present\nprogressive (verb + ing, e.g., this girl is playing) ab use plurals (e.g., babies, horses, cats).\nTotal Language Score\nThe Total Language Score consists of adding the standard scores from the Auditory\nComprehension and Expressive Communication subtests. Miles received a standard score of\n80 (9th percentile rank) indicating below average language abilities.\nInformal Language Processing\nMiles\u2019s communication skills were assessed through clinical observations and play. An\ninformal assessment was used to highlight his strengths and identify his ongoing needs. Informal\nassessment is not standardized and does not compare a child\u2019s skills to age-matched peers.\nMiles demonstrated fleeting attention skills. He was easily distracted and his attention flitted\nfrom one thing to another. Miles showed good shared attention skills, which is the mutually\nshared focus of two or more individuals on an object or action. He was able to use his language\nskills to alert this evaluator to an object using sentences, for example, \u201cI want the black car.\u201d\nA gestalt learning profile is when children memorize sentences as whole chunks at first (a gestalt),\nwithout necessarily understanding the meaning of individual words. This is different to analytical\nlanguage processing and is a characteristic communication style of children with\nneurodevelopmental differences.\nMiles presents as a stage four gestalt language processor (GLP). Stage four marks the\nexpressive language shift from echolalia to self-generated language. This was seen by his use of\nlonger, novel utterances with basic grammar. His vocabulary also appeared expansive, through\nhis ability to label objects during testing on the PLS-5 as well as parent report.\nThe emphasis of Miles\u2019s communication development will shift to increasing self-generated\nlanguage, working on narrative skills and using more phrases with structured grammar. He is\nworking on progressing through stage four. This looks like using mostly original phrases, asking\nquestions, understanding more complex questions, developing narrative skills and higher level\nlanguage and beginning to use more complex grammar forms.\nArticulation\nInformal observation of Miles\u2019s articulation reveals adequate speech sound productions at\nthis time.\nSpeech intelligibility or clarity is based on perceptual judgment, and it refers to the percentage of\nwords in a speech sample that are understood by the listener. The degree of clarity can range\nfrom being unintelligible, or where the message is not understood, to totally intelligible, or where\nthe message is completely understood. Based on various studies, the following guidelines have\nbeen developed: At the age of two years, a child's speech is expected to be 50% intelligible, and at\nthe age of three years it is expected to average 70%. A mean intelligibility of 93% has been\nobserved at the age of four years (Bernthal and Bankson, 1998).\nThis evaluator understood at least 80% of Miles\u2019s speech production during this evaluation.\nMs. Kate reported that she understands at least 75 - 100% of his speech and reported that others\nunderstand 75 - 100% of Miles\u2019s speech. He presented with intelligible speech during\nconversation and was understood at least 95% of the time.\nOrofacial Myofunctional Observations\nOrofacial myology evaluates and treats a variety of oral and facial (orofacial) muscles, (myo-)\npostural and functional disorders and oral habits that may disrupt normal dental development,\nspeech production, breathing patterns and feeding\/swallowing functions.\nA full orofacial myofunctional assessment could not be conducted due to compliance, however\nobservations of his articulators (e.g., lips, tongue, cheeks) revealed symmetrical and intact facial\nstructures needed for speech.\nVoice\/Fluency\nThe vocal parameters of intensity, quality, and pitch were within normal limits. Fluency was\nmaintained throughout the evaluation, however, Miles presented with robotic, choppy speech,\nmaking him sound unnatural. Similarly, he had a slower rate of speech.\nHearing\nBased on behavioral observations, hearing appeared adequate for communication purposes.\nSummary and Impressions\nMiles, a 3-year-9-month old boy, was evaluated on September 19th, 2024 by\nMA, CCC-SLP, TSSLD at ABCSpeak due to concerns regarding his speech and language\ndevelopment.\nFormal testing on the PLS-5 revealed below average language abilities (Total Language Score 80,\n9th percentile rank). Miles can communicate for a variety of functions using short phrases and\nsimple sentences, however his overall language play skills and attention are limited, as seen\nthrough rigid, independent play, fleeting attention, and the use of echolalia in response to\nquestions or directives.\n\nObservations indicate that Miles is likely a stage four gestalt language processor. This is not a\ndiagnosis but is often associated with neuro-divergence. Having a gestalt learning profile means\nthat children memorize sentences as whole chunks at first, without necessarily understanding the\nmeaning of individual words. It is different to analytical language processing and is a\ncharacteristic communication style of children with neurodevelopmental differences, which may\nrequire further assessment. He has a history of using echolalia which is sometimes still sometimes\nevident within his expressive language. However, he is now using more self-generated language\nwhich is evidenced through the use of more novel phrases.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1g7dp2m\/is_my_son_autistic\/","main_id":"1g7dp2m","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-19 17:15:10"}

{"post_type":"s","created_utc":1729380250.0,"subreddit":"Autism_Parenting","author":"Draconis91","link_flair":"Advice Needed","title":"How do you do it?","selftext":"Hey everyone. Just found this sub today so this post is going to be part journal, part vent, and part asking for advice.\n\nWe don't have anything exactly that's an issue but things are just heavy right now. \n\nTo give some background. My wife and I have been married for just over 8 years, we bought our first house about 6 months into COVID and while it was only 1200 Sq ft in an ok\/ not great neighborhood it was ours and gave me the peace of mind to start having kids. \n\nFast forward through a pregnancy and newborn stage at about 7-8 months old our son (who I call Bing bong) wasn't really developing the way that the wonder weeks was describing and so my wife suggested getting him into  PT for a little boost.  \n\n3 months of that and the PT mentioned that things were progressing but there was something bigger at play and that we should go see a neurologist or geneticist.\n\nBless the angel that she is, she was right.  After some wait time, tests and an MRI it was confirmed that our 15 month old has ADNP syndrome.  Functionally what this means for him is that he's cognitively delayed and has low muscle tone so moving is body and other objects just costs him more effort and energy until he can build it up naturally. \n\nHe's predisposed to a laundry list of things including seizures, gastric issues, puberty as early as age 7, and other minor things, but luckily we've been very vigilant and haven't seen anything yet. \n\nFinally the documents about his condition suggest about 97% of kids like him have some form of autism.  We had him evaluated at 18 months but because he was cognitively at 10ish months the doctor didn't feel comfortable officially diagnosing him so she gave him a diagnosis of \"presumed\" autism. \n\nThis lady Tuesday we got into a \"behavior and developments\" specialist who gave him another evaluation because he just turned 2 and she placed him at about 13 months cognitively so he still can't be officially diagnosed but she agreed with the first doctor on presumed autism.\n\nHe's nonverbal but we've just recently learned the sign for eat,  and then more\/ yes got mashed into learning how to clap so it's a special BING bong sign just for us. He's sensitive to new spaces and places, big changes, and getting out of routine, but he's also full of giggles, love, cuddles and a few nibbles. \n\nPacked into there was the birth of our second son in July, who even though he's only 4 months old, his development is night and day more \"by the book\" than our first. \n\nUnfortunately both my parents and my parents in law have been bitten by the recent political movement and their long standing hyper religious backgrounds and my wife and I don't really speak to any of them let alone allowing them to have influence over our boys. (They also live about 1000 miles away)\n\nSo what it comes down to is that it's my wife and I doing the best we can. We send bing bong to a nanny who he adores once a week on Wednesday to get him around other kids and give my wife a break as she stays home with both boys full time, and I work from home so I help out with diapers, lunch, naps, and troubles, but only when I'm not in meetings or other commitments. \n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you. Thank you for your time and your patience in listening.\n\nHere's where things just feel hard. \n\n1. I worry. I worry soo much. I worry about making enough money, about ensuring that we haven't mossed anything, about showing that I worry too much, or making sure that I try to treat him just like the kid he is, not to force him to grow up, but also to not treat him younger than he is. I worry about politics and how that's going to affect us, how much care will he get in school, I know it's crazy but sometimes I even worry about what's going to happen to him in 50 years when we die. I don't want to saddle his brother with that burden but I don't want him to be alone.\n\n*sigh* I know. Most of the time I can handle it but sometimes it's a lot.\n\n2. Our house is always full of stuff. Messy, things everywhere. There's nowhere to go with it all and so we just live around it. \n\n3. Life feels like it's moving too fast.  About 6 weeks ago someone from the city knocked on our door because someone reported our property for having too much mud running off and into the street flooding the sidewalk. So I had to go out and get all the wet mud back onto the property, buy some hay and seed and then just amaturishly reseed a part of my yard. The car needs and oil change, when we were fixing our washer for a leak, I clipped a transition piece of hard wood flooring and busted it so now it looks like garbage and I have no idea where to even start there. \n\nHow do you handle it all? How does it all get done?

My 7yo keeps acting out. She is making huge messes, throwing toys, and getting into things that she knows are off-limits. Much of that is par for the course for any parent. Removing her diaper and peeing in three places in her bedroom is not (yet she refuses to void in the toilet no matter how long she sits). What gets me is that I have no idea how to fix it! The behaviors aren't present during ABA so they can't work on them. Talking calmly gets me nowhere, raising my voice is met with laughter and squeals, and time-outs are useless because she just occupies herself by stimming (which I'll never stop her from doing) or repeatedly tries to get up like everything is normal. Taking toys doesn't work because she just redirects, often to something even more against the rules. She has thrown her toys into the bathroom four times today. By the fourth time, it took every ounce of restraint in me not to scream and curse. I feel completely defeated. She's a good kid overall and doesn't generally get aggressive. I remind myself often that I\u2019m lucky. Many parents raising a lvl 3 kid have it a hell of a lot harder. Right now that's not making me feel any better.

He is medicated for the OCD and we are having some good results, but he still gets really stuck on the idea that he will say or do something that he is not supposed to and has several compulsions that are really socially unacceptable. He learned the n-word last year, from a YouTube video I think, and when he asked me what it meant we were in a public place and said it very loud. We are white, for context. I shushed him and high-tailed it out of there with him shouting it repeatedly and me trying to calmly deflect till we got to a private place. I explained to him that it is a word that I really don't like, that it makes people feel terrible to hear and that I don't like to hear him say it. Well, now it is a taboo compulsion, of course, and he says it compulsively. I have been following the standard OCD advice of trying to not react too strongly and reassure him that he can control the trigger. But he has said it at school sometimes, and there has been one incident where other kids have heard him. His school is pretty multi-racial. The teacher explained the context to the kids but I hate the idea of other kids being exposed to my kid saying it when they are trying to learn. The reason I have not given him much context about the word is because his social awareness is so low that I am terrified of him associating the word with other people and using it when he sees a Black person. I am trying to explain the concept of racism to both my sons (my other one is five years younger, NT) but I think I need to give my son more context for the word and why it is not just a swear word like the F-word.

I know that you can not compare kids to other kids and thats true of both NT and ND kids. But Im really just so curious.\n\nDid parenting feel way harder than you ever imagined? Was your kid delayed or hit milestones on time\/early then regress? Did you always have a feeling that something was \"off\" and no one would listen? Or did the diagnosis come out of left field? Were pediatricians, friends, and family supportive of any suspicions you might of had? Or were you made out to seem crazy and everyone said everything was \"normal\"? What were your first tip offs that your child might be on the spectrum whether it came to food, play, general mood, etc.\n\nMy son is 14 months old, 13 months corrected. Hes way too young to know anything yet. But I have suspicions. Everyone thinks Im crazy or too anxious, and I might be. But I just need to know from people who have lived through it versus from well meaning family members and non chalant pediatricians.\n\nHere are some of the things making me suspicious: Obsessed with spinning toys, doesnt point, doesnt follow a pointed finger, seem to understand language at all (other than his name and no), doesnt seem to understand I am the word mama and his dad is the word dada, doesnt understand any short commands such as come here, doesnt shake his head no, seemingly unable to relax, will not watch me show him how to do things, tenses up and gets upset if I try to use his hands to show him how to do things, obsessed with picking up and dropping items on the ground, doesnt play with any toy \"normally\" (blocks, stacking rings, stuffed animals, baby puzzles, etc.), can literally never sit still (if you stop the stroller or car for 0.2 seconds he starts screaming, wont \"snuggle\" because he can not physically sit still), physically unable to sleep unless he is alone in his crib or pack n play & conditions are perfect (pitch black & white noise). I could honestly go on, but these are the main things.\n\nWhat he does do: Wave, play peekaboo around furniture, put his arms up above his head when someone says yay, smacks his lips to mimic me when I say mama, responds to his name, understands the concept of tooth brushing and smacks lips together when I say lets brush your teeth, understands (and hates) the word no lol.\n\nIm really sorry if this post is offensive in any way to anyone. I love my son how he is even when being his mom is really hard. I just want to be sure I am meeting all of his needs, whatever they are. And Id really love to hear from a parent in this situations perspective.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1g8a9li\/a_major_question_to_parents_to_kids_with_autism\/","main_id":"1g8a9li","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-20 21:59:13"}

After 3 hours of eating he somehow finished his meal and his Mom said \"You behaved unwell with this, no playing, no TV and no YouTube Videos for the rest of the day.\" The Kid threw a tantrum and drama scenes like someone was beating him and loud sobbing as if he's crying - he kept asking everybody in the room if we allow him to watch Videos on his iPad and play games (I guess until someone says Yes and for him that would be enough.) \nAfterwards the father of the kid told me that his wife and her mother never really enforced some rules and always said yes and amen and thus the kid knows if he sobs 1-2 times mom and granny would run and give him everything he asks for even if he behaved wrong. Also told me that whenever the kid and his brother agree to shared TV time, when it's the brothers turn the kid takes the remote away from his brother and doesn't want him to have his TV time - if he doesn't comply he runs sobbing to his mom lying that brother hit him or some and brother get's grounded. \n\nMy Question in this particular case is:\nIs all this happening due to bad upbringing\/no rule enforcing and now if they are some rules kid knows how to use \"holes in the system\" and tries the best to avoid behaving properly?\n\nThanks in advance and I hope to learn a thing or two!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1g8cube\/upbringing_an_autistic_kid\/","main_id":"1g8cube","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-21 00:04:38"}

I had my last day on 10\/4. They are hiring for a new teaching position now. They wrote that the salary is negotiable, and that they are looking for the right fit. Does this mean they'll likely end up underpaying the new employee?\n\nI noticed that my former school quite recently put on their website that they are hiring (position is preschool teacher. I was an assistant teacher and 1:1 aide, but during my last few months really more like an aide.) I noticed \"career progression\" was a new section and initially wondered if 1 of my coworkers who I always regarded as trustworthy had perhaps mentioned in passing after I left that we'd talked about how I was partly leaving because I felt like I wasn't getting anywhere there, but then remembered that for the first time this year they did offer virtual courses (child development ones, I think, ones that a community member had helped them find) so that could have been it.They specified that they are looking for the \"right fit\" and for someone who has enough flexibility to cover shifts for coworkers who are out. They wrote at the top that they are always open to meeting potential candidates. They said salary is negotiable. I am not \"allowed\" to return for reasons they didn't do a good job of explaining (well, because I \"complained\" to \"the office\" - they likely meant the HR department - about not being trained to handle a situation wherein the child wrapped their hands around my neck quite hard a few times while I was trying to change their diaper.)  I was unexpectedly informed this by my new company's heads the day before I was supposed to come back (10\/15) - the heads of the school and child's parents never directly told me this themselves, their communication was very bad.  My former boss had blocked me on Facebook (they'd requested me as a friend months beforehand which actually wasn't appropriate imo in part because I'm 19) after I contacted HR.  But I'd contacted HR because my bosses didn't respond and have me file an incident report after I told them about the incident, and it reminded me that when the child bit me at the start of the year when I was 18, I wasn't asked to document it then either.\n\nThe child's former BT - the one they used to have who we all knew was really bad - actually shoved them (pushed them down) last year when the child bit them.  They were 30 and trained.

She has not been able to go to school due to PNES (psychogenic, non-epileptic seizures) for the 2nd half of the year last year, and this year she was supposed to start in a special school but it did not work out either. Today is her first day in a new, regular school where she was excited to go to.\n\nLong story short, yesterday she had the scariest hallucination episode so far.  \nShe texted me from her room that she keeps having hallucinations, so I went to see her. She said she kept seeing a guy waving at her. I asked her to come out to the living room with me. She asked me something and while we were talking, she told me \"oh my god, oh my god\" with a very scared look on her face and began to step away from me. I asked her what happened and she kept saying \"get away from me\", rushing to the terrace door, clearly being very frightened. She was screaming, running out to our garden towards the gate, barefoot (that she does not like doing due to her sensory issues but I guess she was so scared that she did not realise she had no shoes on), while I tried to calm her down. I kept telling her \"it's just me, mom\". Finally she turned to me and let me come close and she hugged me, crying. \n\nShe said she did not see me, but the man with a knife in his hand... This never happened before and I keep thinking about what if something like this happens while we are on a walk where she could get so frightened that she would jump in front of a car... or hurt herself... You know, all the scary scenarios that you can think of. Truth be told, I am already at my rope's end, I found her attempting suicide in the summer, I saw her self harming, I saw her having seizures (long and short), but this is something new and very scary. If there is one person in the world she should not be scared of, that is me. Luckily it did not take time for her to calm down and the rest of the day went fine, but this was an extremely scary experience and I cannot imagine how she processes something like this. \n\nI guess I just wanted to vent but also to ask you, fellow parents if you ever experienced something similar and how you handled it...

She's not completely non verbal but still quite limited. She has meltdowns whenever she's restricted from doing things, but the problem is she wants to do dangerous things like chew a live wire, or play on the stairs, she runs back and forward and needs to be stopped as she often runs full on into the wall. Additionally, she'll ask for cake or chocolate 10 times a day and when she can't be giving it due to having too much in the first place she will again go into meltdown mode. When she does have these meltdowns she will throw herself downwards at the wall, and has given herself quite a few bad injuries, she'll throw herself head first at the floor, went on the floor. She'll bash her head repeatedly against the floor. She freshes out her arms in front of her and tries to hit anything that's on a surface. She has no regard for whether a baby is around her or whoever younger child is near. Additionally, we have a new born, so the daughter with autism's meltdowns are becoming a much bigger concern.\n\nI don't know how to get her to accept that she shouldn't be able to do these dangerous things in the first place which trigger her emotions. We usually try counting, nursery rhymes, taking her somewhere quiet, giving her a specific toy. Is there anything more heavy duty that we should try? We're worried that she'll hurt herself or another child. And this is the core reason that her school is giving for why they won't allow her there for more than 2 hours per day.

She knows lots of words but her speech is unclear - I understand her words but noone else really can. I'd say she has around 50-60 words that she knows, but she never joins any.\n- In the past couple of weeks, I've noticed her speech has started to regress - she's using a lot of \"babble\" again. Instead of telling me what she wants like before (she'd use the word previously), she just grunts and points, or makes funny noises whilst looking at what she wants. I've also noticed her understanding is regressing a little, for instance, she used to be able to identify a butterfly or snail in a book, but now she seems unsure and doesn't point to them when asked. \n- Her sleep is terrible. She's never been a great sleeper, but she's now awake til 10.30\/11pm every night, full of energy and wanting to play. She doesn't respond when I tell her that it's bed time; she ignores me. She climbs in and out of bed and wants food and wants to go downstairs and generally fights sleep at all costs. \n- She's started to ignore me when I ask a question - she answers maybe 40% of the time but the rest she just ignores. \n- She's started being funny with food. She used to eat most things but it's getting very beige - last week she wanted pasta for every meal. She spit out the spag bol sauce (mince and veg) with it, she physically wouldn't eat anything but the pasta. \n- She doesn't really interact with children her own age or younger, she's not interested in them. She loves older children, particularly her cousins who are  4 and 5. \n- She's never been into dolls etc. She does have dolls and has sometimes patted them or laid them in a towel like I do with her when she's had a bath, but otherwise she doesn't interact with dolls. \n- She doesn't share toys at all, or really acknowledge when I tell her it's kind to share and to let another child have a turn.\n- She gets very upset about getting dressed in a morning. It's a battle, usually with tears and her trying to take her clothes back off. \n- She doesn't respond if I'm upset or I express that I'm not happy about something. She finds it funny (this may be pretty normal for a toddler though as I know empathy comes much later).  She also doesn't really respond to being told off. \n\nOther things to note:\n- She lives with me (mum) about 60% of the week and her dad the other 40%. English is not her dad's first language but his family speak to her in English and they spend a lot of time with them. I suspect her dad may have Autism. His family aren't great communicators and his parents have a strained relationship so she witnesses a lot of aggression\/poor communication. \n- She knows all her colours and will name them when asked. \n- She points when interested in things. \n- She has good eye contact with me and plays well with me. She's a very touchy-feely (a little clingy if I'm honest) child with the people she loves but not outsiders. \n- She's had a VERY big year. House move, childcare change, new pet, time away from me (mum), started sleeping at her dad's for the first time and this has now built up to between 1 and 3 nights a week.

During nap time it is license requirement to lay quietly on the cot for 30 min. We cannot force him to sleep but he has to at least sit on his cot. We have been working really hard implementing quiet voices, walking feet, and no throwing toys. I notice one-on-one works good with Kai but I can\u2019t provide one-on- one several times through out the day because I have multiple children.  Can we please work together so Kai can approve with his challenging behavior. I\u2019m willing to use techniques you\u2019re using at home. At the moment I\u2019m having a challenging time.\n\n\nI completely understand he can be a lot and I am in the process of possibly getting him into ABA therapy since I\u2019m in parent led ABA myself. I\u2019m still doing research since this is all new to me. I\u2019ll post my response and her last response in the comments. Any advice is needed. I work full time and so does his dad.

I just need to vent and say everything. \n\nMy son (15, ASD1\/ADHD) has always had difficulty with tough emotions. He used to run away and I honestly as much as this likely sounds awful to people who experience kids who elope --- I wish he would just go back to that. Instead, we got him to stop eloping around grade 2 and now instead his meltdowns are full on rage. He was never violent with others, only to himself. But he says the most awful things and threats, and they can be so scary to people that don't know him. I understand that. He does too, when he's not afraid. He says he says the things because people will be afraid of him and leave him alone. It breaks my heart. \n\nIt has gotten far better over the years, especially at home. He rarely has issues at home. He gets mad at me sometimes, sure, but doesn't threaten me. School has gotten better only because he was going to a private school for the past 3, for kids who need extra help\/low class numbers. The first year he was there I had to pick him up a lot, but then the 2nd year was better, and the 3rd there was only one time and I sent him an Uber (he was fully capable of getting in the Uber on his own)\n\nExcept I couldn't afford it anymore to be completely honest. I am a single mom who has 10k owed in child support to her and spent every penny I did have on private school. So he went to public high school this year. \n\nHe was expelled today. \n\nA couple weeks ago, he was being bullied by a group of kids. He made dumb jokes and they got mad at him. They didn't let it go over the weekend. They gossiped in front of his face to other kids making fun of him in class one day. They confronted him in a hallway at a class they're not even at with him the next. He didn't tell anybody, including me. The day this all happened he text me saying he had a \"sore throat\" and wanting to go home. He often feigns sick to get out of school, so I encouraged him to stay. He didn't tell me he was worried they would hurt him. He didn't tell me about the bullies at all... Why?\n\nAt lunch, he was still mad at himself for the dumb jokes he made and how he was never going to have any friends. He was throwing pinecones and stuff, not at anybody in particular, just throwing them to get out the anger. He also threw a stick while he was walking back to class. We didn't know it wound up bouncing and hitting a kid in the lip until a few days ago. \n\nAfter the stick hit the one kid, the bully kids got up and started calling him names again, calling him a pu\\*\\*y, mocking him, and all the other typical teenage bullshit. My son wanted to look scary so they'd go away. \n\nHe picked up a rock about the size of his palm. He started saying mean scary things. \n\nThe other kids tried to take it from him. He held it up higher and backed up. It's all on camera. Then one of them pushed him. He tackled that kid and then they all piled on him. He got free at one point, then tackled again now on his back. He wound up hitting a kid in the face with the rock then threw it away. \n\nThe teachers broke it up, and the police came. He was charged with assault with a weapon. \n\nI have been in panic mode for the past two weeks calling every community agency, doctor, etc. that I can find for him to help us. The school spoke to us about what they might think is best for him. I told them everything I was doing, and they said they had no other suggestions. They did say to get into some of the programming I wanted, it might mean expulsion. Even though I knew the expulsion was probably coming, I am still so devastated. \n\nI cannot remember a year where we didn't try some sort of therapy to help him with managing peer conflicts. He's medicated. Goes to a special needs camp for 2 weeks in the summer without incident. For 99% of the time, he's a good kid. Around NT peers, most especially in school, he can't cope. \n\nFor the transition meeting between the private school and the high school last spring, we all said he needs help during transitions and especially lunch time. He is not always great at managing peer relationships during free time. They were supposed to have volunteer job in the library for him or something, and I did intend to bring that up at his IEP meeting.... but they didn't send out IEPs until after the incident. I should have pushed harder and earlier before this happened. Shoulda woulda coulda.\n\nHe's expelled. I don't know what the future will bring. \n\nWill he ever get better at managing conflict? Is he always going to be loud, aggressive, and scary when he can't handle it anymore? Where did I go wrong?!? Why can't he remember to stop himself from saying scary things? Why can't he just tell people he needs help??\n\nI can't stop crying.

We are a military family who moved to a new area 3 months ago.  Our son was diagnosed with autism about a year ago and we are expecting an ADHD diagnosis soon.  Prior to the move, we were well set up with our son in a special education preschool class with an ABA RBT in class with him, speech and OT during the week and access to a year round theme park that he loved.  He was doing very well in his last class, so much that his previous teachers recommended he start integrating with other classes during specials.  His ABA therapists stated they were on the fence about graduating him, but thought he could use more time if we wanted to continue.\n\nSince moving, the new school district placed him into a fully integrated kimdergarten class without telling us that was their intention and knowing we expected him to integrate more slowly. He is visited by a special education teacher and therapists a few times a week in class. We have been unable to set up ABA or therapists outside of school, stuck on waiting lists.  He has been extremely combative with school dropoffs.  He's also pretty large for his age, just over 4 ft tall and nearly 70 lbs.  My wife struggles to get him out of the car and the school doesn't allow walk upshort-lived. \n\nHe constantly talks about going back to our old house and going to the theme park he loves.  He has also started getting violent with his sister.  When confronted with homework or going to school or any other activity he wants to avoid he deflects to his sister, saying it's her school, or her homework, or she wants to do it, implying he doesn't. The one somewhat success I've had is breaking out one of his K'nex rollercoaster kits and  using it as an incentive, but that seemed shortlived.  He seems like he's a little depressed and I know it's because he misses where we used to live.\n\nI'm hoping this is just part of his adjustment to the move.  It just sucks that he's still struggling so much and he is regressing with schoolwork and I feel like he's at the same point he was nearly a year ago.

Still having problems understanding most things he's trying to verbally tell me. Uses an AAC device well, but often times can't get through to me what he needs to say with that either, so for the last year he's been turning to physical aggression. Hitting, biting, scratching, pulling my hair. One time he slammed the back of his head into my face so hard that my nose bled. I'm so, so lost. I've turned to his school for help and they're offering me advice but it's just not helping. His doc put him on medication and it just turns him into a zombie. I told him that I want to address the problem behaviorally, with therapy, then he just suggests putting him on more meds. I'm so lost.

I just don't want it to get to a point where I can't physically defend myself anymore. I'm short. He's getting tall. He's STRONG. He has given my life purpose, he has made me better. Also, life is so, so hard sometimes. This part right now, it sucks. \n\nAnyway, not sure what the point was of me posting here, other than I just need to be heard my someone that understands.\n\nIf you've made it this far in my novel, thank you for reading. I really do appreciate my life, and love my boy with every fiber of my being. He's LITERALLY the reason I'm alive, he saved me. I do not have a terrible life, it just sometimes feels impossible to cope with. Having one of those hopeless kinds of nights. \n\nThis isn't even the half of it.

I'll try to keep this brief...\nSince my son (7yo) doesn't have ABA on Mondays after school (he has a fun after school program in the Fall) and the weather is incredible right now, she had the idea of taking him to a riverside park in our town that we almost never go to because it's a good place to throw rocks in the water (he loves that.) For the 1st 45 minutes or so, it was nice, but my son has these little dinosaur toys that he MUST have and play with almost everywhere we go and he decides to throw one in the river. However, it's low tide and just landed in the muck. He immediately wants me to go get it, but I told him no way, that's deep mud and he needs to learn that sometimes you throw things and they don't come back. At first, he seems to have taken it well, but eventually he was lobbying hard for it. After some screaming and crying while getting him out of there, I felt bad and thought, maybe I should go home and get my muck boots out of my work truck and go on a secret mission to rescue the toy and surprise him with it later. Fast forward... what a shit show! I jumped in and what do you know my first instinct was right... deep af. But somehow I thought, \"well, I'm here, might as well get the job done.\" BIG MISTAKE! I lost my muck boots ($220 steel toes), I ruined my Levi's, messed up my Nike dryfit shirt... a couple of Indian guys going for a walk saw me out there and were concerned. \"Hey buddy, do you want me to call somebody?\" \"DON'T CALL ANYONE! \"DO YOU NEED HELP?\" \"I'M GOOD!\"\" LOL I threw the toy up to where they were to secure the package. I was too proud to let them help me so I pulled myself up the 6' wall. I walked to the car with no shoes on, covered in mud, toy in hand. Thankfully, my wife wants us all to go everywhere together and she is in shock when she sees me walking up to the car. I strip to my boxers on the sidewalk trying to be discreet (good thing it was night.) I tell her \"the things we do for our kids\" and she called me ridiculous. Kinda pissed me off a little. She was laughing at me for a bit.\n\nI didn't mean for things to get so out of hand. If I didn't work out 2-3 times a week, those guys would've had to call 911 for me. It could've gotten really dangerous out there, matter of fact, at one point I hit a really soft spot and got stuck bad. I'm glad I got the stupid toy (a pterodactyl squeek toy), but I learned a valuable lesson about going the extra 2 miles to placate my son, especially when I wanted to make it a teachable moment. Autism makes parents do stupid things sometimes. At least I have a conversation starter for Thanksgiving this year.

When searching for DIYs and how-to's, I came across this sub, but the post was for young children, so definitely out of my weight class.\n\nWhen I grew up, I always had a swing in the garden, a proper one like the ones you find on playgrounds. Since I never got diagnosed as a child (only found out as an adult), I never connected my own mental and physical wellbeing to my hours long sessions on my swing. \n\nIn 2020, my parents split, the house got sold and I \"lost\" my swing. I didn't notice the impact of the loss at first, but as the years went on and the more I learned about myself, it dawned on me what integral part this \"toy\" has played in my life up until now (I'm 28 now and was on the swing until 2020, sooo) and after years of struggling, I finally conceded the point that I just don't have any other thing that soothes me like my swing did. I probably never developed many if any other coping mechanisms because I had one right outside the terrace door, so self-soothing in that way was always available (minus winters, of course). \n\nNow, I'm looking for an indoor swing that gives me back at least some of the sensation of swinging back and forth (crucial. It can't be swinging in every direction because that makes me queasy for some reason) to relax after a long workday and get my brain and body to calm down. Problem is, the swings that go back and forth are usually installed at the ceiling and I don't want to do that since I live in a rental. The others with a frame usually lack the back and forth option because of their design or can spin in any direction which is unfortunately out for me. \n\nNow I'm researching ways to maybe put something together myself (I like working with my hands, so that's no problem), but how do I get a proper, sturdy frame that holds 51kg? Do some of you maybe have some tips or pointers what to look for\/look out for? How do you as parents of adult autistic children who like to swing help them out? Did any of you embark on a DIY journey to find a solution? I, unfortunately, can't ask my own parents. My mother might be willing to help, but has no idea about this kind of stuff and my father unfortunately disregards everything about my struggles. \n\nI'd appreciate any help and I hope I wasn't trespassing on here. Please let me know if I should remove the post or tagged it incorrectly, mods. \n\nThank you all in advance.

I hope it's okay to post here. My son doesn't have an autism diagnosis. He had a formal assessment right before he turned 2, but it was inconclusive, so they told us we can come back at 3. He does have a speech delay, which I know is common amongst autism and we do plan to go back for another assessment at 3.\n\nWe've been in speech therapy since my son was 10 months old (when he wasn't babbling). He's a little over 2 now. He has around 50 words (all approximations), but hardly uses them. He mostly just babbles still.\n\nOutside of the first few weeks, I haven't found speech therapy to be that helpful or impactful... like at all. We got some great tips during the first while and worked on implementing them in our daily routine, but everything since then has been very generic and repetitive.\n\nWe've gone through different therapists throughout this time and it's all been the same. A lot of his therapists seem like they don't know what to do with him. He has good joint attention, non-verbal communication, and receptive communication, so all the 'building blocks' are there, but he still has trouble expressing himself verbally. Some have suggested it could be a motor speech issue, but because of his age there isn't any motor speech therapies they could try with him.\n\nA lot of our sessions are spent playing with him and trying to get him to talk by trying out different strategies, but these are all things we do at home with him too. We haven't learned any new strategies or had any meaningful goals in a very very long time.\n\nIt all feels very pointless, honestly. We still do the sessions because I often hear others raving about how much speech therapy helped their child and I'm hoping that one day it'll be like that for us. I don't think it's the therapists, since we've gone through a few different ones, but could it just be that we haven't found the right one for him? Are you guys doing anything differently in your therapy sessions that you feel like have really positively impacted your child that maybe we haven't found yet in ours?\n\nThank you.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1g9nplf\/in_what_ways_has_speech_therapy_helped_your_child\/","main_id":"1g9nplf","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-22 17:24:13"}

Preparing for my child's evaluation","selftext":"My 2.5yo has an evaluation for autism in a few weeks. My husband and I think he might have mild autism (along the lines of aspergers - my step son was diagnosed with this when he was 2, he is now 14).\n\nI was just hoping for some thoughts on whether or not these might be seen as symptoms of autism...\n\nMy son has never slept well, he keeps himself up\/fights his sleep for both naps and bedtime - this has been since he was born. He wakes up multiple times a night and it often takes awhile to get him back to sleep. It's to the point that he pretty much always has \"bags\" under his eyes.\n\nHe is physically aggressive. He hits, scratches, throws toys at us, and he doesn't seem to feel bad about it afterwards. He does show sympathy\/empathy if his 4yo brother (my other bio child) get hurts from something that wasn't caused by him - like if my 4yo trips and starts crying. He will give his brother a hug\/kiss to make him feel better. However, if he is the one who hurt his brother, then he does not show empathy\/sympathy - same thing if he hurts\/hits me and my husband. He often does this if he's not getting his way or not getting attention, so I'm not sure if this is a sign of autism or if just his personality\/how he handles those situations. This happens everyday, numerous times a day.\n\nWhen he was younger, he would have meltdowns in which he was inconsolable. Face red, screaming at the top of his lungs. He still does this, but I can't always tell if it's a tantrum or what is known as an autistic meltdown - I would say between infancy and around 2 years old, it was for sure meltdowns, not tantrums. But now I can't really tell which it is because sometimes he does calm down relatively quickly. He does still cry\/scream to the point of making his voice sound hoarse, it just doesn't last 45min-two hours like it used to.\n\nHe does not like to wear short sleeve shirts. He only wants to wear long sleeves because he likes to pull the sleeve over his hand and put the fabric against his mouth\/chin. He gets upset\/frustrated with t-shirts because he tries to pull the sleeve down but obviously can't. We finally got him to stop using a pacifier about a month ago, but when he used one he kept the sleeve tucked under the pacifier, against his mouth. He still does this, just without the pacifier now. He also likes to keep blankets right against his mouth\/chin when using one. Not sure if this would be considered a sensory thing?\n\nHe repeats things a lot. He will ask the same question\/make the same statement over and over. Example: \"Where daddy go?\" \"He is upstairs.\" Then continues to ask that question several more times.\n\nI'm not sure how to properly explain this (sorry if it doesn't make sense), but he will randomly grasp something very intensely, to the point of shaking\/sometimes face getting red, and kinda make an \"eeeee\" sound as he does it. It's not in an upset\/frustrated way, he'll often do it while smiling\/being silly. But it's clear he's not doing just to get a laugh, just kinda does it on his own accord. I don't know if this is a form of stimming?\n\nHe really does not show the typical\/common signs. Like he makes plenty of eye contact, he is social, plays with others, responds to his name, very verbal\/has communication skills, doesn't get upset by loud sounds, doesn't arm flap or line up toys, etc.\n\nThese things were enough for his pediatrician to suggest the evaluation, but I'm just not sure that all of these things are considered legitimate signs.\n\nLike I said, he has an evaluation scheduled next month, I'm just looking for some thoughts on these things from parents who have children that were diagnosed.

He is not only unable to speak, but has extremely limited understanding of language, which is extremely challenging. I\u2019ve also noticed that he does not understand the concept of rules at all. You can guide him away from inappropriate behaviours, but unless you are on him, I f he sees the opportunity, he will take it. This is especially visible around food. \n\nHe regularly steels food from people when out in public. He is so quick, he will clock it in the corner of his eye and strike at the exact moment to try and get what he wants. And he knows how to feint so I think he\u2019s moving past it right before he makes his move. It is actually pretty admirable if it also weren\u2019t such an issue. I have paid to replace so many drinks and food for people.\n\nLately he has added a new thing to it of a death hold on the item. Before we could at least catch him and make him let it go, now he will hold on for dear life and get it to his mouth to tear open packaging with his teeth like a feral tasmanian devil\/child hybrid. Recently he got ahold of a small bag of chips at a party and death griped it so hard he reduced the chips to powder before he fought it to his mouth where he shredded the bag and exploded the chip powder everywhere.\n\nIt has become super stressful. I cannot take him to the grocery store, he can\u2019t take him to restaurants or parties, I can\u2019t take him to other houses, I can\u2019t even have a normal meal at home as he is grabbing at any food left on the table as we are trying to get him back to the living room.\n\nHad anyone experienced this before?

{"post_type":"s","created_utc":1729637952.0,"subreddit":"Autism_Parenting","author":"s1ndiego","link_flair":"Celebration Thread","title":"A (positive) 2 year journey of a father","selftext":"If you're anything like me, you've probably been checking this subreddit daily since your child's diagnosis. At first, I was checking daily desperate to hear that someone else's child with the exact same symptoms as mine ended up independent and doing okay. Then, as my wife and I faced hard times, I started reading posts to compare notes and see how other parents were holding up. The reality is, most parents who post here are at their wits' end or in need of immediate answers and help. So I thought I'd share my journey for any fathers out there who might relate.\n\nMy son was diagnosed at age 3 as \"level 2 or 3\" on the spectrum. Since this is an old account and can be traced back to me, I won't share too much about my son, but I\u2019m happy to answer any DMs. Either way, until relatively recently, my wife and I came to terms with the fact that he may never speak.\n\nWhen we first received the diagnosis, my wife and I fell into a deep depression. I started drinking, stopped exercising, blamed everyone around me, and resented anyone who said the \"wrong things.\" A childhood friend joked that he hoped he and my son could go to the casino if he ends up like Dustin Hoffman's character in *Rain Man*, and I cut ties with him. My father was upset that I told other family members about my son's diagnosis, so I stopped talking to him, too. The list goes on.\n\nAbout two months after the diagnosis, I had a pre-paid ticket and hotel booked for a legal conference. I was still crying daily at that point and in no shape to attend a conference, but my wife insisted that I go. I broke down multiple times a day at the conference anytime a friend or colleague would ask how I'm doing. Even when I didn't want to talk about his diagnosis, any question about where I've been or what school my kid is going to would inevitably lead to me talking about it.   \n  \nOne of the speakers on the last day was a motivational speaker. After his talk, I approached him as he came off the stage and tearfully told him my story asking him for advice. He said he had no idea what my journey would look like, but if I did three things daily, I could become the best version of myself\u2014and that's what my son needed. His suggestions were: (1) Focus on your health: consistent sleep and try to move daily. (2) Start journaling. (3) Eat well and cut back on drinking for 60 days, then see how you feel.\n\nAt first, I shrugged off his advice as typical motivational speaker BS. My son hadn't slept through the night once in the last two years and I didn't have time to \"eat well.\" It sounded too simple, and I left the conversation annoyed, as if he owed me more.\n\nA few days later, I found him on Instagram, apologized, and told him I would give his suggestions my best try. I realized I had been making excuses. My wife and I agreed on her taking sleep responsibilities and other changes I needed. As I started the journey, my mind began to clear, and I noticed that those simple steps were making a difference in my mood and work. Now, two years later, I can honestly say I\u2019m in a good place. Because of my son, we cut back on socializing significantly, which gave me more time to focus on myself. My relationship with my dad and friend improved, my firm is doing well, and I\u2019ve returned to my former baseline of happiness. In fact, my son's diagnosis has ignited a fire in me and given me a purpose to accomplish things I never thought possible. My son's speech and behaviors have also significantly improved, which I think a combination of therapy and being on strict diet and supplements have helped. \n\nDo we still have meltdowns that lead to tough days? Absolutely. Do I still get emotional and cry about my son's diagnosis and thinking about the challenges he\u2019ll face? Certainly, but much less frequently and I know I\u2019m in a much better place to handle life's challenges.\n\nIf you're a father going through tough times, I hope this gives you a bit of inspiration and perspective. Us parents going through this struggle often feel very lonely because 99% of people will never understand what we go through.

Sure, I'd say his speech is delayed by about a year (my kids are 1 y younger and I'd say they are at a similar level), but we got such a nice connection when I visited recently.

Originally for speech delays and then adhd. He was misdiagnosed as a kid and I was told that he didn\u2019t have autism. It was just his adhd. Tbh I didn\u2019t agree with it but my son got his IEP and was doing better so I didn\u2019t put him through more testing. \n\nOf course as he got older it became more apparent. In 8th grade I asked the pediatrician to put in a referral. Then Covid happened and by the time he was seen he was a month from turning 16. He was diagnosed with autism and rated with a level 2. He was also given a diagnosis of a language disorder. \n\nIn 2022 when he started 10th grade he begged to be at home and do online because of bullying. I agreed. In 2023 he stayed home and earlier this year I put him in classes through the autism center for teens to learn work skills and other basic skills. I had to drive him 3 times a week 45 min each way. He also did individual and group counseling. My husband thought it was a waste of time. \n\nWell he decided he wanted to go in person his senior year. So I enrolled him back into public school. I just had his IEP meeting. And I\u2019m in tears right now. Tears of joy. He is doing so well. Not just his grades either, he\u2019s been on honor roll before. But the comments and feedback from his teachers. Some of the things that were mentioned by the teachers\n\n- he asks for helps when he doesn\u2019t understand an assignment or instructions (prior to the classes I had him enrolled in he never asked for help. Ever!)\n\n- he is a hard worker and is a tenacious student. He doesn\u2019t give up easily when an assignment is too hard\n\n- he participates in glass and in group discussion even when he\u2019s obviously shy (he never participated before and would shut down in the past)\n\nAnd he has dropped all testing accommodations as my son (he was at the meeting, he turns 18 in two months) felt he didn\u2019t need it. \n\nThey dropped his curriculum assistance (CA) class. His CA teacher felt he didn\u2019t need it and asked his sped teacher why he wasn\u2019t exited from his IEP. He\u2019s doing that well. \n\nHis load next semester is heavy and he has English 4 and English has always been his biggest weakness. So he is going to be in a class that has 2 teachers so he has help available IF he needs it. That is the only service he will be getting. \n\nAnd lastly, his art teacher was there as well. And it was mentioned my son wants to go to a 2 year college but doesn\u2019t know what major he wants yet. He said he wanted to suggest art. That he takes art at wake tech and go into that field. He held up some of his artwork and tbh I haven\u2019t seen his art since maybe 6th grade. It looked like a tribal mask and it was pretty amazing. It looked realistic. \n\nI mentioned he\u2019s always been good at art and his teacher stopped and corrected me that he isn\u2019t a good artist but a gifted artist. The head of the sped department said he\u2019s worked with the art teacher for years and have done hundreds of IEP meetings and he\u2019s never heard him refer to a student as a gifted artist. \n\nMy son asked me to buy him a sketchbook about 2 months ago. Now I\u2019m tempted to ask him if I can see what he\u2019s been working on. \n\nI\u2019m so proud of him. Those classes seem to have made a huge difference. They seem confident he will be able to adjust to the outside\/real world. He\u2019s waiting to hear back from vocational rehab as well. But I feel much more hopeful about his future after that meeting.

I was pregnant and exhausted with my second son.  I would lay on the floor and my autistic toddler would run circles around me.\n\nI had a nervous breakdown and was put in a mental health ward while pregnant for a three day hold.  I knew my son was autistic.  I knew it was the most severe form.\n\nPeople tried to reassure me that with therapy and time my son would be okay\/better.  We spent thousands of dollars in our own money for speech therapy (insurance paid for tons of ABA but not for speech therapy- and I most prayed and wanted my son to talk).  I do not regret spending all that money to try to get speech out of my son.\n\nI hated hearing stories from older parents that had level 3 autistic children.  I vowed that my son would overcome it.  And I feared that he would not.  It was my worst fear.\n\nI also feared that my son would age out of school.

I have a nonverbal three year old daughter. She was diagnosed earlier this year and is currently in an ABA program. \n\nI feel like we've made a lot of progress with potty training, but we've kind of hit a wall in terms of her communicating the fact that she needs to go.\n\nEither her father or I have to initiate the process. She doesn't decide to do it on her own. One of us has to let her know that it's potty time. Once we do that, we walk with her to the bathroom and she knows the routine. She gets her potty seat, puts it on the big toilet, then gets her stool and places it in front of the toilet. All of this is done without prompting. \n\nThen, she waits and I have to remind her to pull down her pants and diaper which she will immediately do. Then, she sits down without prompting and goes. Once she's done, she gets up. I haven't been able to successfully get her to wipe on her own. She expects me to do it and if I put toilet paper in her hand, she just wants to tear it into a bunch of pieces.\n\nShe takes off the seat and moves the stool so that she can wash her hands. I have to help her flush, but at least she generally puts her hand in the right place to do that. Then we wash her hands and I always have to remind her to dry them. Then I have to get her dressed again. She's fine with taking off her clothes but the only clothes she can put on without assistance are her shirts. \n\nAt school (it's ABA therapy within a preschool setting with other children), they've stepped up the potty training and they say she's doing well. \n\nWhere I'm concerned is her inability\/unwillingness(?) to communicate the fact that she has to go? Am I expecting too much from her? I hoped that the AAC device we recently got would help, but so far she hasn't used it to communicate the need to use the toilet. (To be honest she doesn't really use the AAC device yet. I'm hoping that will change once she gets used to it.)\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to coax a nonverbal kiddo into communicating the need to go potty?

We have a wonderful family\/neighbor a few houses down has a son M16 on the spectrum.  He tends to fixate on people, in the past it has been other neighbors\u2019 children and it has recently turned to a fixation on me, F42.\n\nThe first incident was about 2.5 weeks ago. He tried to enter our home and knocked on our door around 8:30pm.  Because it was dark and we wanted to make sure he was safe, we let him in and then his dad came trailing after him, apologizing and trying to coax and drag him home.  I walked them home and chatted, but the whole time, their son had his hands on my wrists and I didn\u2019t want to upset him, but I eventually pried myself from his grip and left.\n\nSecond incident- during the long weekend recently, I started getting strange calls from an unknown number during a trip. Because my husband tends to call from different offices at work, I picked up and got a garbled \u201cMiss MyName, FaceTime? FaceTime?\u201d I was so freaked out by the call I hung up and blocked the number because I had no idea who it was, but they knew my name. I finally connected the dots after my trip that he managed to get my number from his dad\u2019s phone and call me from his iPad.  He then went on his mom\u2019s phone and called my number-because our daughters play together, I picked up and realized he started calling me from another number that wasn\u2019t blocked.\n\nThird incident- yesterday his mom came to us asking if I had time to see him for a couple of minutes. He had refused to go to school until\nhe could see me and his mom promised him after school. As soon as he came home, he pleaded with her and she said I was working and to wait 3 hours. As soon as the 3 hours was up was when she showed up at our door.  I said I was making dinner and would text when I was done, around 6:30 pm. I went over, set a timer for 2 minutes. He asked to to tickle palms and then tried to escalate to hugs, which I said no and that it was time for me to leave and that we could no longer entertain this.\n\nFourth incident-today, he walked straight into our home-our door was unlocked because we were expecting our son to come home from sports practices.  Luckily my husband was downstairs, he basically put his arm around him and turned him around and said I wasn\u2019t home\/was working (I was upstairs working).  His parents were trailing behind and my other neighbor saw him walking in to our home (he was previously fixated on their son) and called to check on me. I had asked for her advice yesterday as she is a schoolteacher and the other child he was fixated on happened to be the school counselor\u2019s daughter and she mentioned establishing boundaries and communicating firmly with specifics, like time.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do here. As a mom, I want him to be safe, but I also need to care for my own safety and for my family\u2019s safety.  He towers over me and is very strong.

Sometimes they can be curved, other times, tonight, not.

It\u2019s horrible, we also live in an apartment. \n\nLately I\u2019ve been closing the door to his room when this happens and waiting for him to come out. I have a camera, sometimes he will come out okay others he will come out still upset, sometimes he will stay and calm down, sometimes he will cry until I have to intervene again and maybe get lucky. I grew up with a highly autistic sister, I\u2019m in the spectrum as well, the screaming is too much. I know people suggest headphones but I live in an apartment I can\u2019t exactly guilt free allow him to just scream and scream. For me, him or the neighbors. I don\u2019t want him to feel like he has to scream! When he wants things other times he will grab up, bring it to us, etc. when he is like this it\u2019s like our presence makes it worse, TV makes it worse, he is just so angry.  \n\nUntil he isn\u2019t, and then everything just stops. Sometimes he\u2019s actually tired and goes to sleep but I just wonder does it always have to be this way. Sometimes he just calms down. \n\nI\u2019ve tried and try: white noise, music, silence, lights on, lights out, brush sponges from OT, weighted vest, compression, reassurance, rubbing.

Our autistic son attended this daycare for just 8 days. We paid for the first month in full, but the owner tried to charge us for 2 more months of tuition after we withdrew him. Thankfully, we won the first trial because the judge ruled it was unethical to demand payment for time our son didn\u2019t even attend.\n\nHowever, instead of accepting that, the daycare owner decided to appeal the case and has dragged us through over a year of legal hell. Our lawyer\u2014who we thought we could trust\u2014didn\u2019t show up to three different court dates, which we weren\u2019t even made aware of. Because of this, the daycare won by default. Now we\u2019re being forced to pay not only 2 months\u2019 worth of tuition, but also over $5,000 in their attorney fees on top of what we paid our useless lawyer.\n\nThe final straw came when the daycare owner went to court and pulled the classic \u201cKaren tears\u201d routine, crying to the judge to make herself look like the victim, when she\u2019s the one who wronged us from the start. We could fight back, but we simply don\u2019t have the financial means to continue. We\u2019ve already spent so much time and money, and it\u2019s breaking us.\n\nI believe that daycare should not be allowed to get away with this, and I don\u2019t want other families to go through this kind of trauma.

My son only says a few words mostly yay, wow and no.

I do work from home and he isn\u2019t in day care yet so I\u2019m not sure if that plays into some of his issues. Instead of pointing he will just try to push us towards or grab our hands and place them on whatever it is he wants or needs help with.

He doesn\u2019t mind loud or random noises but he does get super upset if you yell at him. He also used to flap his hands when he got upset but I haven\u2019t seen him do it in a few months. I have done a screening or survey w his doctor but she said some of our concerns are normal for tots especially ones who don\u2019t go to daycare.

He has never had a problem with school drop off since 3 years old in preschool. Never. This year, it has been huge meltdowns, fat tears, crying and screaming, curling up into the fetal position and screaming mommy, whining, etc. He hasn\u2019t told me anyone\u2019s bullying him or anything to make this make sense. \n\nWe are supposed to drop them off in the car line and they walk down to a blacktop alone. That wasn\u2019t going to ever happen so I get out with him and we have breakfast in the cafeteria. He supposed to leave from there by himself and go to the blacktop to meet his teacher and classmates. Sometimes he\u2019ll do that if he has a buddy but if he\u2019s tender or anxious he\u2019ll ditch the buddy and cry and scream for me. So then I stay with him until he class walks by and sometimes he\u2019ll join them, sometimes he\u2019ll cry and whine. His classmates and teacher don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, they think something happened to make him upset but it\u2019s just his anxiety. I\u2019ve even walked him all the way to the classroom door to say goodbye and he still balked and started to cry.

He's on anxiety medication because his anxiety was causing massive meltdowns. :( He becomes violent during an meltdown. They kept trying to say he was tired. Um no.

My brothers always needed a lot of attention (they don't have autistic characteristics, they were just very rebellious and violent), so my parents never noticed anything about me. \n\nThe fact is that I cannot see autistic characteristics in my childhood and this makes me reluctant to seek a possible diagnosis.\n\nMy mother is terrible at remembering my childhood too. My father didn't even participate in it properly. The only things that could lead to autism would be the fact that she had difficulty making friends, she was always alone at school and at home. Emotional difficulties and expressing empathy. Crisis due to a lot of noise and disorder when fights occurred. Hyperfocus. Frequent crises in the classroom (they always admitted that they were anxiety attacks). Poor motor coordination, I always hit everywhere when I was walking (this was something my mother complained about a lot, but now she doesn't remember). I became obsessed with a series as a child, and I watched it repeatedly, every day. More specifically, a compilation of scenes where my favorite character appeared. I memorized the lines in my language and in the original language. I loved and was fascinated by her!\n\nBut anyway, I think they could be because of creation too. I only played with my cousin, but anyway, I liked being with her. We used to record videos with stories (I also simulated scenes from my favorite series), tear up old magazines (yes, we loved doing that!) and I taught her many things. But as far as I remember, we also had \"common\" games like dolls.  \n\nI'm thinking about having a neuropsychological evaluation, my psychologist talked about a referral. But I'm seriously thinking about whether it's worth it. \n\nAnyway, I would like to know what symptoms you observed in your child in childhood that made you question level 1 autism support.

I recently posted about my newly diagnosed level 1 autism son. We just moved into our new house on Saturday, which is ~30-40 minutes away. It was a decent transition but behavior was a little rough for a few days.\n\nHe is still going to the same daycare\/prek which is 30 minutes away. He was off from school Friday through Monday. He went back Tuesday. It was... A rough day. He hadn't been listening at home as well for two days and then at preschool, he got in trouble for hitting and pulling hair. He RARELY hits or gets physical at school. So we immediately knew it was due to the change in routine and change into a new house.\n\n His behavior has leveled out at home and he's doing better at school. He finally LOVES his Pre-K teacher and loves his friends at school. He talks about them a lot .\n\nHere is my dilemma - I could potentially get him into a daycare closer to our house, maybe 15 minutes closer to our house. However, I'm hesitant and panicked because not only does he love and is happy where he's at, but I'm afraid too much change will make him regress again.\n\nI am aware that next year, he will start kindergarten and will have to change to an elementary school and go through big changes.

{"post_type":"s","created_utc":1729819273.0,"subreddit":"Autism_Parenting","author":"zombiesnail30","link_flair":"Advice Needed","title":"Clueless mum in need of advice","selftext":"Hi! It's almost 3 in the morning and I can't sleep, because my 12 year old level 1 decided to go to her friend's house after I went to bed (and when I thought she was getting ready for bed). I only found out when her friend's mum called me to make sure I wouldn't have a heart attack when I found out my daughter wasn't in her room. The said friend does live close by, fortunately, but it still entailed a 12-year-old girl cycling alone in the dark.\n\nMy daughter left as a response to my asking her to stop studying for her test by 10 PM. We didn't even have an argument - I warned her she had time until 10 an hour in advance, then when she couldn't stop, I came into her room and gently took the laptop away. I told her that ahe worked hard enough already (she has) and that she'll surely pass it, but she does need her sleep.\n\nThis has been the last straw. The entire journey with her has been difficult, ever since she has been a baby. I had her young and her dad and I were not together by the time she was born, but he's always been in the picture - even though most parenting was done by me.  When she got diagnosed with autism and adhd earlier this year, everything started making sense. I started doing a course on understanding autism and also signed up for coaching for her and myself together to improve our relationship dynamic, as I am a firm believer in that if there is a bond, there is hope. Or, perhaps, I was. The bond, I feel, we've always had, but I thought we could use a little help with it.\n\nHowever, it feels like the harder I try to understand her, be autism-friendly (being adhd-friendly is easier for me, as I have it myself), give her everything she needs, the harder she pushes back. For a month, there has been a struggle to get her to eat at the table  with us (myself and my partner). Her reasoning: we chew too loudly, and she can't stand it. Pre-diagnosis, I would have brushed it off as kid's sassiness, but now I realize there will be many things I won't be able to relate to, but it shouldn't be the reason for me to dismiss that. She described how agressive it makes her feel when she hears chewing or loud breathing, and I thought, could it be a misophonia? The puzzle, however, is that she has no problem having lunch at school, at her friends' homes, with her dad or anywhere else, because \"they chew less loudly than us\", which I just cannot buy. So, I am more flexible now to let her eat in her room if she is overwhelmed, but that means I barely get to see her despite living with her.\n\nWhen I do see her, however, it seems like she looks worse and worse. She stopped eating lunch at school dismissing it as \"not being hungry\" and she has bags under her eyes. She also gets irritated fast and prefers talking to me as little as possible (and this from being almost inseparable from me for the most part of her life until this point). She spends the entire time in her room, and when I come in for a chat, she sends me away rather quickly. Also, she starts on her homework towards the evening, as the time before, according to her, she has no motivation.\n\nAnyway, I put 2 and 2 together and figured she might be addicted to her phone. She recently got a new iphone from her grandma after she accidentally broke yet another phone. She comes home from school and goes on her phone first thing, while being in bed. I have to work, so it's difficult for me to control what she does. Then, after averaging 7 ours, she'll start on homework and go to sleep late. The agreement was that she'd put the phone in the hallway to not be tempted to use it before sleep, but today, after I discovered that she was gone, I saw that on the spot where the phone had to be there was just the empty case. I don't know how long it's been going on for.\n\nSo, my conclusion was, she spends so much time on the phone, tiring her brain, that she leaves homework until it's late. So, I thought, after she comes back from her dad (she's finally going to stay with him for 4 days), I'd get strict rules: phone use will be toned down to 2 hours a day, and available only after she's done her homework. All screens out at 9. Then, hopefully, she'd start getting enough sleep to function again and to just be a kid.\n\nHowever, now she left the house at night without my even noticing, and I am not even sure anymore what to do with her. Her friend's mum (the angel that she is) said she can stay at theirs, and I thought it was a good idea, as I didn't want any yelling in the evening. Mind you, I don't yell. My daughter does. But I think tonight, I could. Best not to take any risks.\n\nSo, the question is, what would you do? I will talk to her for sure and explain what it was like in my shoes and how dangerous what she did was. But the thing is it's not the first time she just takes off as she pleases (although, the 1st one at night). I had those conversations with her already, so what will it even do?\n\nThe phone, instead of being toned down to 2 hours a day, will be replaced altogether by an old nokia for month or so. But how do I make sure she actually doesn't run away again? Tonight wasn't even an argument (apparently, it was from her side, but I was very calm and loving), but what happens when she doesn't like the consequences and the new boundaries in general? What if it will be a regular occurance?\n\nHas anyone ever been in this situation? I love my daughter very much and try to support her everywhere, but parenting her is so scary and overwhelming sometimes! The most I get out of her these days is rudeness, yelling, and now this on top of it. I feel like no matter how hard I try, I am failing her even more, and I don't know how to keep her safe at home. \n\nThanks if you made it so far!

She helped us secure an out of district placement with our public school after our son failed to receive appropriate services.

Today, though, the back of his ear turned red, so I took him to the doctor right away.

Sometimes he tries to get up to watch TV or use his tablet. He doesn\u2019t nap during the day and it\u2019s not like he falls asleep at school so I don\u2019t really know what else we can try. I don\u2019t live with him and my parents so any advice I can relay to them would be greatly appreciated.

It was always in hand. He was social, made plenty eye contact, always in a good mood, never had a tantrum ever, he loved his swing.  I had a second child when he was 2 years for months and he loved and was very interested in him. He had only picked up a few words until he turned 3 but around his 3rd birthday his vocabulary exploded and from that point on and I to school people always commented on his vocabulary and how he used such big words and talked so well for his age. \n\nThe only time he got in trouble in school was the younger grades and it was always for laughing like a joke or another kid being inappropriate etc but he would just have to sit in the hall until he was done laughing. He had no behavioral problems and never made trouble and school or at home.  He was always well liked by his peers and played with friends. He did always have a horrible memory and a hard time remembering a simple task like go upstairs and get the brush from the bathroom. He would repeat it to himself while he ran up the stairs so he wouldn\u2019t forget. He always was way weird about food textures, like yogurt. \n\nOnce he got to middle school he started having horrible anxiety, he was still well liked but not interested in seeking deeper friendship with his peers.  His anxiety got to the point we switched to online school in 8th grade and he did that without any nagging from me or help from anyone and graduated on time. \n\nHe has a group of friends he met online who all still talk 7-8 years later. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the last couple years we started wondering, he had never tried to find friends, was too anxious to get a job, still was forgetful, had specific interests but still nothing stuck out to me as more than like anxiety sprinkled with a little ocd. \n\nBut he jumps, he started jumping when he was maybe 7 and still to this day, he is 20 and he jumps. I knew that was odd and maybe I should have been able to roll it all together and see it but I didn\u2019t.  He has been an awesome help and primary baby sitter to his younger siblings. \n\nWe finally got in to the neuroscientist and got lucky that insurance covered it. He was there for 6 hours and a month later we went to a follow and got the level 2 diagnosis. At first I thought no way until we started going back and thinking of things that had happened. He scored college level, reading, spelling and comprehension and has a 95 iq but I see it now and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m happy or sad that we didn\u2019t know until now. Happy he didn\u2019t grow up with any stigma but sad that some of these issues could have been addressed years ago and he wouldn\u2019t be 20 years old feeling bad about himself for not having a job or contributing etc. \n\nI feel guilty being here and seeing such a hard time others are having and I\u2019m feeling guilty I didn\u2019t put all the 2s together and figure it out sooner for my own kid. \nIs there anyone else who had a similar story?

He also stays very focused on one topic for a while, like his current favourite thing is the show \"The Walking dead\" he could tell you every fact about that show and he doesn't stop talking about it. He hates the sound of jackets and fireworks each year are a huge issue for him and we always have to leave. He doesn't eat lots of our dinners and says \"They don't match in taste and feeling (Whatever this means?)\" And seems to have a lot of sensory issues. He struggles to make friends and often comes across as quite disinterested in other people. He also has some sort of anxiety and stuff. And this is stuff now he is older, when he was younger me and my wife just assumed he was a bit delayed due to him being a preemie and also knowing kids develop at different rates.\n\nI'm just a bit concerned because he is very different than his other 3 siblings. And I want to do what's best for him. And I realise that but I also don't know what to do or where to even start this process so I thought coming here for a bit of advice or even just people asking me questions. I don't know.\n\nI'm just a dad who wants to help his son.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1gc25jf\/a_dad_looking_for_some_insight_for_his_son\/","main_id":"1gc25jf","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-25 19:11:34"}

Last week I posted celebrating my 5 year old daughter\u2019s first ever best friend. I remember I said \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to last 4 days, 4 weeks, or 40 years.\u201d\n\nIt was one week. And it ended explosively. On the bus ride home\u2019s my daughter was sitting on this girls lap, and tried multiple times to kiss her on the lips. When the other girl told her to stop and turned away, my daughter started punching and scratching her. She left marks. The girl she attacked and her family are from Ukraine and don\u2019t\nSpeak much English. We\u2019ve written them a thorough, sincere letter of apology, which I hope they can translate. She\u2019s been suspended from taking the bus for three days, but we had already resolved to remove her from the bus until further notice. The case is being referred to the principal, and we are just hoping it\u2019s not bad enough for \u201cone strike, you\u2019re out\u201d discipline.\n\nWe\u2019re horrified. Thunderstruck. Deeply saddened, right down to our bones. Last night, after the kids were in bed, my wife was raving about how our daughter is evil, and we\u2019ll have to spend the rest of our lives trying to protect people from her. That maybe she\u2019d disobey like she always does and ride her bike in the street and get hit by a car, and we\u2019d be better off. \n\nNow she and I are fighting because I can\u2019t get behind or put up with the things she said.\n\nHow does a family survive this condition?\n\nWe feel so desperate. It\u2019s hard not to long for life to be different than this. Why her. Why us. \n\nI\u2019ve read other parents of \u201chigh-functioning\u201d ASD kids complain on this sub how they don\u2019t get any respect or understanding from the Autism community. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever experienced that, and for that I am grateful. \n\nBut, this is the struggle facing the parent of a high-functioning, level 1 child: your child is normal enough to be able to interact with the world and other people like a NT child, but touched just enough by this disorder to make their behavior seem wicked and evil to the rest of the NT world. And because they seem like such a \u201cregular\u201d child, no one can understand that \u201cregular child\u201d discipline just doesn\u2019t work, because her brain does not function the way you\u2019re expecting.\n\nSchool has been very positive for her. Kindergarten has been such a big win for us.

He also started sleeping more. He wasnt a terrible sleeper before, but sleeping on the low end for his age group. This makes me think that is mind is calmer. He is eating more now than he was when we started and is much calmer in the afternoons.\n\nCons: I think he is becoming more anxious and anxiety-prone. He is more resistant and quicker to anger. He has developed new fears about certain slides that he used to climb and go down without problem. He is now really unhappy to see my sister, which is very occasional. He is also spending a lot more time in his room, hoarding toys in his bed. He usually spends a few hours at his grandparents' house, but he has been more reluctant to go and spending time only in their car or one bedroom. I think these are his \"safe\" spots.\n\nThe climax today was that he was running, tripped, and fell into a structure, and needed stitches. He was never clumsy or poorly coordinated before; aside from one fall on the stairs, he has never had a problem with getting into accidents.\n\nHe goes to ABA and his performance has gone wildly downhill, however, they have also changed many staff, including his BCBA and rearranged rooms and room assigns which has created chaos as well.

Looking for some advice and what would you do regarding my 2 year old son.\n\nSome context: he has a gross motor delay and always has.

I have hypotonia and hypermobility myself, walked late, but no other developmental challenges. He's been in PT since 9 months and is often very resistant to therapy.\n\nWhat he does well:\n- very verbal, many words and language grows each and every day \n- great eye contact with us and strangers\n- very social, converses, looks for reactions, good reciprocal play, \n- responds to his name\n- points and gestures \n- no sensory sensitivities, though he likes climbing and movement activities \n- plays with his toys functionally\n- likes other kids \n- low risk on mchat other than not walking \n\nThe hard:\n- he is resistant to most PT. He likes his weekly sessions because he's familiar with the therapist, but new therapists making him do hard things causes him to get very upset (he's happy as can be to just play with them)\n- therapy related meltdowns can be big\/hard to calm him down from at times\n- transitions can be hard as of recent- like leaving the park when he's having fun etc.\n- some separation anxiety with mom and dad\n- gets frustrated with motor related tasks that are hard for him, like if he can't reach something he wants\n\nA therapist (not his usual one) thinks this is autism, but the wait for a developmental ped.

We were pretty blindsided by the suggestion of autism for him as we have been so focused on the gross motor, but just want to help and will be supportive however we need to be.

We're having trouble with his IEP team right now as he's being painted as unable to learn, after just having earned a 0% on his progress report for Q1. We met to also start speech services at school, but it was brought up in the meeting immediately before we got to talk about speech. I was told that my son is still rather anxious at school, becoming upset at 9:30 everyday (pickup time is 10 as he goes from 8-10 everyday) and otherwise will be happy. They said he mostly plays alone, roams the classroom, and is not open to doing work or being interacted with by the teachers. \n\n  \nThis is my son's typical behavior when dysregulated. He sort of isolates himself and self regulates with blocks or time alone. He used to be in tears when in this state but with OT and lots of love he's moved from that. They told me he's done no school work all year, and did not offer any methods theyve tried but did ask for any tips i had. I told them he does a lot of floor time at private OT, as well as pairing preferred and nonpreferred activities. We've seen tons of progress with these. They honestly seemed mystified with these ideas, which i honestly thought were pretty basic and probably not gonna be super helpful. They asked to change his goals to be more attainable, which i agreed to, and we went over some changes. \n\nThere's been some issues in the class this year. Six students and three, soon to be four teachers. 5 of 6 kids inclusing my son leave by 11am, with one staying the full day. But a few students are really struggling with not melting down and becoming violent. The violence is both towards students and staff, and also includes self injurious behavior that's led to those kids being restrained. I only know this because I'm friends with the other parents. The school has been in constant contact with them and trying t brainstorm ideas to help, and i completely understand why. Meanwhile, I've heard nothing from the school. During parent teacher meetings last month i was told that my son was working on writing his name, but this is apparently untrue based on what i was told today, and i was told he was adjusting well, which is apparently also untrue. I was also told today we may need to consider if the school is a good fit for my son next year, and when i asked why i was told that they dont have all the resources he needs. When i asked what resources so I'd know what to look for i wasnt given an answer. \n\nI told them I'm a bit concerned that he hasnt had any progress in even a singular goal, and despite having potty training goals that he comes home in the same pullup i sent him in most days, obviously not having been changed or attempted to be taken to the potty, leading to his pants becoming soaked as he walks out or soon after. I also shared that i think he is dysregulated in class because of all the chaos, that he's rather sensitive to crowded or chaotic situations and being hit or watching the restraining of students happening may be a lot for him. They seemed shocked to hear he could be struggling in that environment. And that when one student is breaking down, all the teachers are preoccupied with trying to calm that situation as i know they sometimes last over an hour, and takes multiple teachers to handle it, and that leaves little calm time for my son to work on his goals. I also said that its concerning i wasnt contacted sooner, as i know the parent's of some of the \"chaotic\" (i hate using that word for them theyre very sweet and well regulated out of school) are in contact with the school quite often, and just because my son isnt having behavioral issues doesnt mean his educational problems arent important, especially if they're bringing them to me now saying i should find a new school next year. I didnt tell them that I'm aware how stressed his teacher is, as its her first year and she does not have a teaching degree or classroom experience but i do feel like that plays a role. \n\n  \nThe school was offended that i said i thought my son may not be getting enough attention to meet his goals, stating when a child melts down they bring in the principal to be there and sit with the class, but she isnt working on goals during that time shes basically babysitting, which i do appreciate for everyone's safety but isnt the same as learning. They didnt offer any explanation about what theyve tried to help him, or what more he needed from a school. I did get them to agree to let him come from 11:30 to 1:30 daily so he's not part of the chaos and may be able to learn. We're in a rural area, with little options for schools, so to be honest the next closest school with an autism program that would be a \"step up\" is an hour away. I'm feeling a bit flustered and blindsided. Am i wrong to feel like i shouldve been contacted about this sooner if it was of such concern? The only team member that agreed with me was the speech therapist, who didnt act like i was crazy for thinking dysregulation = hard for him to learn.

It makes me think about if I could have spared some time to just put him to bed like usual but I know I couldn't risk it because some days it could take an hour to get him to sleep from the rocking and I couldn't spare an hour or otherwise I would have gotten nothing done. But still the guilt of not being there for my wife and child is terrible. And for my other 3 children who had to hear their brother screaming for hours when they have school the next day.\n\nI know how lucky I am that he is for the most part such a good sleeper. But still, it's difficult when you have such a good sleeper to suddenly having a terrible night. It happens on the rare occasion because of course sometimes I'm not able to be there everynight, but it's never easier no matter how many times this has happened.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1gc5n2p\/i_felt_so_guilty_and_helpless_last_night\/","main_id":"1gc5n2p","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-25 21:46:35"}

Not in a troublemaking sort of way, but sensitivity-wise. He was a late talker \"selective mutism,\" they called it. But he was very advanced with his spatial coordination and fine motor skills.\n\nWhen we'd visit the grandparents house, it would be a struggle to get him to come inside. When he did come, he'd hide under a chair for a good portion of the visit. I recall one birthday where he must have been maybe 7 and his friends were playing in the yard and he watched from his window! However, subsequent birthdays he didn't do this.  \nAt age 12 I somehow got him to try an overnight camp. He couldnt make it through the first night but it didnt help that his roommate basically ignored him in favor of people he knew and the dorm was pretty drab.\n\nHe sometimes asks before we go to a new gathering how many people will be there. Right now he wants to quit rec soccer. He says it's overwhelming, he doesn't like the pressure and being watched.  It didn't help that the coach said \"it's going to get harder and harder.\"He does well in school, especially in math. But I'm concerned that his social anxiety (?) is going to make him pass up opportunities in life.\n\nDoc precribed 5mg lexapro, most of what I've read recommends talk therapy in addition to this...he said nothing about pairing it with therapy. He gave the analogy to asthma--while a person could certainly go through life unmedicated by just avoiding sports and other triggers, that wouldnt be a fun life.\n\nMy son and I completed the SCARED survey for him and he got a 24. Doc said most kids get 5. But the test said scores of 25 or higher are indicative of a problem? At least that's how I am reading it.I do have a referral for an autism evaluation pending for over a year. This is due tot he above behaviors plus he gets rather fixated on certain things---hard to get him to put away summer clothes when winter approaches, and vice versa.\n\n  \nI hate to medicate him at a young age and my husband is against it.

But i wanted to make a post to all the parents in this group who struggle daily to make sure our kids are given the best quality of life we can give. \n\nI see you, not literally, I hear you, again not literally. But i do. \n\nHi, my name is Star. I'm 26 years old. I'm an autistic adult. I have 2 boys. Both autistic. My oldest is 7 years old, has higher support needs and nonspeaking. My youngest is 5 years old, he is speech delayed and has lower support needs.\n\nThis week has been shit. I have a sinus infection and body aches. My oldest has been very moody lately, thinking growing pains. He has been kicking the shit out of me, staying up past bed time, my night meds don't even help at this point.\n\nI get the frustration. Its hard. You have a lot of people thinking autism is basically Sheldon or Sam from atypical maybe even Dr. Shuan from the good doctor. \n\nYou have a lot of comparisons. A lot of unwanted advice from people who don't even have autistic children,  but they know someone who knows someone who has an autistic child. \n\nThe holidays are rough, our holidays are not the same as other families. We have to keep the environment the same, avoid certain things to avoid overload. We plan more diligently.  When family comes, maybe some of you guys dread it as I do, because again unwanted advice or opinions. Never helpful but will damn sure back away when a meltdown happens , then once it's calm, they come back with unwanted advice. \"You should do this. Have you tried this?\"\n\nAnyone relate yet?\n\nThe struggles of grocery shopping, people may suggest curb side but hell it's nice to get your own things to pick them out but (maybe some will relate), grocery shopping can be damn hard. Your kid has a meltdown, stares. Your child is on an iPad to regulate, stares. Don't get me started on restaurants or trying to go on a vacation. Does that happen? (Lol)\n\nI tend to find humor in things, it makes the days easier. I know it's hard, you vent to parents online and suddenly you may get comments that you don't love your child,  or you use your child's diagnosis to victimize yourself. I see this often, in parent support groups.\n\nI know people with neurotypical children get criticism, unwanted advice, etc but I feel at times that we get the most. We can't vent, we can't say how hard it is, we can't say sometimes we just don't want to wake up. We get shamed. We are still human. No one plans for this. It doesn't mean we don't love our children any less.\n\nAside the judgment, we have to fight for our children's therapy, school, support, we fight the insurance. Managing all the different programs so much paper work in the beginning, shit even still. SSI is even a bigger struggle, just so your child has what they need. \n\nI see you and I hear you. I just hope everyone knows they are not alone, support may not be in person, but this group support is here, maybe posts or comments might not help during the stressful moments. I am thankful for this group, I see a lot of parents who have similar struggles to mine, they have children with support needs similar to mine. I learn, I appericate, I also hurt for some parents who are alone in this, with no outside help. I feel that to my core. I appericate you guys even though I do not know you on a personal level but thank you for sharing your parenting experience. I can't cover everything that  can be experienced.

We just got an Autism diagnosis almost 3 months ago so don\u2019t have too much experience or knowledge just yet. \n\nMy son is 2.5 and has a handful of stims & quirky behaviors that don\u2019t bother him or anyone else, but some of them have gotten worse. Like what used to be harmless hand flapping when excited has turned into flapping his own face and others. He rarely does it when he is mad or upset, more like during excitement\/over-tiredness, but when he does get upset he does it more intensely and actually slaps himself\/others.

But it is always in an effort to play, never out of aggravation\/ stress. We try redirecting, moving him off the bed\/couch, sternly telling him to be gentle, nothing seems to work. It\u2019s really getting stressful to us because we know he doesn\u2019t do it to be mean or cause harm but we don\u2019t know how to satisfy his sensory needs.

Can probably pass for NT most of the time, but he just seems so heartless towards his peers.\n\nHe's always been cruel to his 3yo sister. Never misses an opportunity to contradict her or put her down. He screams at her for the slightest thing, frequently \"lightly\" physically bullies her, and will also kick her if he becomes irritable. Tormenting her is his coping strategy for any stress. When caught he often gives us this horrible forced laugh as if he's trying to convince us it's all a joke. It's just so sad... she spends literally 95% of her energy just helping or being nice to people (including him), I feel like I'm constantly looking out for her. It's only a matter of time before she starts resenting him.\n\nAt school, we had heard stories of him getting in people's faces or not keeping his hands to himself (sometimes from other kids, sometimes from staff). Then yesterday, his after school program supervisor told us that he and 2 other boys kicked another boy until he cried. When asked why, he just said that they didn't like him. When pushed for more, he said something about the kid not sharing a ball. He just doesn't get that he needs to ask an adult for help if he's having such a problem. Is this normal?!?! Gang-beating a kid?!?! \n\nHe was punished immediately, no screen time for the day. Seems like a light consequence but he spent the next 2 hours crying bitterly, so we think it made the point. We've tried discussing these events with him from different angles, with varying degrees of casualness and accusation. At first we just asked what the other two boys were doing, as if he wasn't even involved. That was just to start though. It's been made abundantly clear the next time he hurt someone like this it would be 3 days, or maybe him getting pulled from the program (if he isn't kicked out). We can't even get him to acknowledge that the crying kid was hurt, let alone find any pity for him. We're thinking about having write an apology note or buy a gift with his own money, but I don't know, he'll probably just see it as more punishment. Based on what I've learnt, rage does seem to be a frequent, uncontrollable symptom of the spectrum so we don't want to overdo the punishing, although we're certainly not going to let it go.\n\nSide note, I do wish the people running the after-school seemed more competent, they look like a bunch of random people they hired off the street for minimum wage, I doubt there's much training or experience between them. It's like \"Lord of the Flies\" out there. Maybe this could have been avoided. We were hoping socialization might help him, but that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nSo anyways... yeah. Is this just a part of growing up ASD? We're starting occupational therapy soon (along with everything else we can find), but I'm just clinging to the hope that he can grow out of this somehow. He does show a degree of affection towards animals, maybe that's a good sign. I just hope he's going to be ok with the baby we're expecting next week (he says he's excited for it), we'll be watching him.\n\nThanks for hearing me out.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1gcia10\/trying_to_find_a_shred_of_empathy_in_him_not\/","main_id":"1gcia10","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-26 10:42:15"}

He\u2019s quite smart though, he\u2019s very talkative and explains things well. We assumed it was because he has an older sibling so he started talking younger. In every other way it seems like he\u2019s a \u201cnormal\u201d kid except: his tantrums.\n\nHe had epic meltdowns. Far beyond your typical 2 year old. He will have an hour long meltdown over the fact that *I* got dressed and he didn\u2019t want me to. When he\u2019s upset he gets MORE upset if I\u2019m not where he wants, sitting when he wants me standing or in the wrong place, or vice versa. He wants to control not just his own things but other people\u2019s. He\u2019ll often yell that he doesn\u2019t want me\/his dad\/siblings there and to go away or \u201cI don\u2019t want you to talk to me!\u201d \n\nSometimes he\u2019s okay, often it\u2019s a battle. Our lives feel like they are run by a 2 year old and we\u2019re exhausted. His meltdowns and inflexibility are impacting his sibling as well and it feels unfair. He takes a LONG time to warm up to someone but he will eventually. He has never been a good sleeper and he\u2019s very sensory seeking (your typical hyperactive ADHD).\n\nMy therapist, as I\u2019ll talk about him, suspects he may be on the spectrum but hasn\u2019t met him and won\u2019t say much more since that\u2019s not her place. She did say his need to control external events is more autistic than adhd. I guess I\u2019m curious on what we do now. Is this enough to be worth seeing a behavioral therapist for? He seems like a very typical kid outside of his inflexibility and angry meltdowns. What is your experience? (NOT looking for a diagnosis, just some lived experience as we don\u2019t have any). Is this atypical enough to pursue this? Or are we likely to just be written off since there aren\u2019t enough other symptoms at this point?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1gcrgw3\/therapist_thinks_my_25_year_old_may_be_autistic\/","main_id":"1gcrgw3","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-26 18:24:29"}

He started ABA this summer and toileting is one of his goals. We\u2019ve developed a point system to incentivize him to pee and poop in the toilet. He can pee in the toilet just fine but will not go to the toilet unless we tell him to. If he has an accident he will not tell us. Pooping is basically the same thing except the only time we have ever been successful with actually making it to the toilet is when we see his very subtle signals and rush him there. \n\nHe never followed the typical toddler potty signals. We were always told to give him time. Well he\u2019s 5, almost 5.5 and still can\u2019t figure it out. At this point I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s more of an OT and sensory issue more than anything else. He can verbalize what he\u2019s supposed to do. He just doesn\u2019t.

I have an autistic low verbal 4-year-old. She is low support needs- we haven't been given a specific level but that is what we've been told and she absolutely hates all forms of communication\/speech aids & will not choose any alternative form of communication at all.\n\nWe've tried cards, the flippy book that you can point at, the tablet, sign language, etc etc.... we've tried every option\/device available to us and she hates\/refuses them all. We've tried everything recommended and suggested and numerous approaches over the past 2.5 years and nothing. Her speech has improved amazingly in that time but she will not go near any of these things. She actually hid the tablet and the cards because she hated them so much. And I'm not going to push something that she hates that badly because I don't want to create like a really negative association you know?\n\nAnytime we try to explain that these help her talk she gets very annoyed and yells \"I talk! I talking!\" And consistently chooses verbal speech or attempts at verbal speech anytime she wants to communicate. So I'm coming to the conclusion that these devices, though absolutely amazing and groundbreaking and life-changing for so many families, are just not the right tool for our family. However, anytime I say that to anyone, professional or not, their response is essentially that I'm not trying hard enough and that these work for every single kid and that I'm just not doing a good enough job and that's why it's not working. \n\nAnd that doesn't make sense to me because all children are so unique and so different so it doesn't make sense to me that there is a one-size-fits-all answer and that it's my fault that it's not working rather than it simply just not being the tool for the job. It feels like I'm trying to fix a window with a hammer and people are just telling me that I'm doing it the wrong way. \n\nShe wants to talk. And I keep explaining that these will help her talk but she hates them and keeps choosing verbal speech and her speech has improved so much over the past 2 years. Even the past several months has been almost night and day. \n\nHas anyone else been in a situation where the professionals are pushing something that just isn't working? Is it an incorrect approach? We are doing it exactly how we've been told by the speech therapist and early childhood support team. I don't think we're doing anything wrong. I think it's just the wrong tool for the job. Does anyone else have a kid that just hates all of these things and won't use them? I just feel so frustrated and not listen to and kind of alone. I feel like I'm the only person advocating for my kid.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1gd0ywl\/no_one_is_listening_to_me_and_its_doing_my_head_in\/","main_id":"1gd0ywl","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-27 02:21:16"}

I didn't even think about it at the time,  because so far, parents have been welcome to join for other parties we had gone to, but seems we are reaching an age where drop off is now expected. When we reached the mum basically told me to come back in 4 hours. \n\nWe're not yet at the stage where I would leave my asd 9yo alone at a party. Though her communication has gotten a lot better, she still has challenges with toileting and most especially might slip away if she sees something she's interested in (e.g a dog outside) or if she gets scared of something (she's scared of party crackers and things that make noise).  It would barely be okay for a regular playdate with parents I trust to actually keep an eye on her,  but a garden party where everyone is busy and the gate is constantly opened and closed is just not yet okay. \n\nI explained the situation and they at first said they'll look after her, but then were fine with me staying and everyone actually had a lot of fun. Of course, I did my best to help out with the party and also didn't really eat anything since I know I wasn't planned for.  But I still feel kind of bad to invite myself in such a way.\n\nSo my question is,  how do you handle birthday invites.  Do you check in with the parents in advance, whether it is drop off or parents are invited to stay? Do you explain that you'd have to stick around for your asd kid and offer to bring some extra snacks or whatever? Or do you just not go when it's a drop off party?

When he was 5, and becoming explosive at school, we started seeing a pediatric psychiatrist. It was a game changer for my kid but over the years the medication became less effective with undesirable side effects. Since then we've tried a few different combinations. Latuda seemed promising but the past couple of weeks he has become excessively tired during the day, and having troubles sleeping at night. \n\nNow my family I dont believe respects his diagnosis or the choice to use psychiatric meds as a part of his treatment. We had him formerly diagnosed by a neuropsychologist who is renowned for his work in the feild. These diagnoses were based on evaluations done without me present and teacher report. He was thorough and comprehensive in his evaluation of my child, including cognitive function.  \n\nTonight my mom texted me with \"he's excessively tired...very worried\". I explained that he woke up in the middle of the night and was caught eating spaghettios on the couch watching TV. He's been taking this medication for 2 and a half months now and this is the first time he's been to grandmas is several weeks. There hasn't been any recent change (such as an increase in mg). His psychiatrist is on leave and it's on my radar that he is waking up at night and tired during the day. I am not sure what I can do right now other than reduce the mg myself or see if I can meet with one of her colleagues to address my concerns. Normally I'd email her and she would get back to me quickly. \n\nRegardless, my mom treats me like I am doping him up intentionally. His brother has ADHD and takes a stimulant. She acts like I am giving him a gateway drug completely disregarding the progress he has made at school since taking the stimulant. Its so frustrating, I am doing the best I can and I have educated myself as much as I possibly can on the efficacy of medication and have thoroughly considered the risk vs benefit. \n\nThere is a substantial body of evidence supporting the use of psychiatric meds to improve quality of life, and increase positive outcomes in kiddos like mine. Even a reduction in the likelihood of doing at risk behaviors such as drugs, alcohol, unprotected sex, etc. Their psychiatrist is autistic herself and a total nerd when it comes to giving children the best chances in life. If I were diagnosed today I believe I'd have a similar profile to my 10 year old. My life has not been easy, and I only want what's best for my children. I dont want them to suffer the way I did. Why does this have to be stigmatized, depriving them of evidence based help should be stigmatized!! Ugh now I am ranting!

We've been going through the process in one way or another since he was about 2.5. \n\nHe's fairly low support needs in some areas, his main struggles are anxiety, rigidity, some sensory issues and sleep. \n\nOne phrase I notice a lot when I'm talking to friends about day to day stuff is \"I don't know how you do it\" or \"I couldn't deal with that\" or some variation. \n\nUsually around how I'm up for all hours of the night with him, but also things like finding creative ways to get him washed when he's having a bath refusal phase, managing his (very intense) separation anxiety, thinking 3 steps ahead on everything. \n\nThese things are just our normal and to be honest they've improved massively over time, a mix of our son being that bit older and us being more confident at knowing what works and what doesn't. But it's been very hard work getting here, with basically no professional input. It will continue to be hard work, with new challenges popping up all the time, but we'll get through it.

If you had to work out an exact routine each morning to get him to nursery\/school and arrange it so you knew 2 safe staff members would be ready to drag him off you (where he'd then be safe and happy because you've worked with the setting and know it's ok) You would do it. Because there is no other way. \n\nWe're not passively going along with it and we're not some separate breed of people blessed with super powers, we're just people doing our best and sometimes struggling because it's hard.

He\u2019s autistic and very loving, and watching him grow has been a joy. He was late to start talking, but now he can hold more of a back-and-forth conversation. As a parent, it makes me so happy to see his progress, but there are still times when I feel really frustrated.\n\nHe wants to play with other children and be involved in group activities, but he struggles with social situations. He's passive, so when other children take things from him or hit him, he doesn\u2019t stand up for himself\u2014he just cries. He\u2019s in a class with typical children, and I\u2019ve noticed some of his behaviors changing, but it\u2019s still hard. His sister often ignores him, and when I bring it up, his father excuses her behavior, which is another source of frustration.\n\nHe requires a lot of redirection. I find myself having to repeat things over and over, and sometimes he engages in behaviors that can be challenging, like putting his hands in people\u2019s faces or getting too close to them. He also stims, which usually doesn\u2019t bother me, but some days, like today, it drives me crazy. He has control over using the bathroom, but won\u2019t usually go unless I remind him.\n\nHe was receiving ABA therapy, and it made a big difference for us, but he hasn\u2019t been getting it lately because of issues with his last therapist. It feels like we're losing some of the progress we made.\n\nI love my son so much, but sometimes I wonder if my frustrations come from his autism or just because he\u2019s four years old. I talk to him constantly and am very involved in his life, but I often find myself exhausted. I want to accept him for who he is while also helping him thrive.\n\nHonestly, I hate going to the playground because I feel like I have to helicopter-parent to protect him from other kids, which makes it hard to just enjoy our time together.\n\nI'm open to any advice or support from parents who\u2019ve been in a similar situation.

He's always running around and modeling what we do at home (ie trying to use the litterbox as a sensory bin, mopping the floor, wiping tables, using his kitchen set). I taught him how to water the outdoor plants with a watering can and he'll do it over and over until I stop him. It's really amazing to me that he can learn by watching us. At level 3 and almost 4 years old (in 3 months) I never thought he'd be able to learn so much. He puts his whole heart into everything he does, despite not being able to talk.\n\nHe also doesn't feel comfortable sleeping without us and will get anxious when we sneak away. When we go to a park, he will run for hours in an open field (we have a few enormous parks here). He rarely stays in one area, so we're constantly chasing him (can you believe toddlers run so quickly?)\n\nHowever, I can barely keep up with all the jumping, running, constant exploration of how the world works, always being awake. \n\nSometimes, I just want to relax at home with the kids while watching a movie with them and not have Twin A bring out all of his toys and grab my hand to participate in re-enactment of all the scenes.\n\nHis psychiatrist (we're both not willing to let him try meds for anything) says he clearly has traits of ADHD. What are some methods to get him to relax or focus?\n\nIs this just typical toddler behavior? His sister, Twin B, is level 3, as well, but it's easier to do calmer relaxing activities.

We saved and scrounged, ate beans and rice, and finally moved our three kids from a two bedroom apartment (1100 sq ft) to four bedroom (2300 sq ft) house with a fenced yard, unfinished basement, and attached garage.  It's been a month or so. \n\nOur six year old is the most severe of our autistic children, and we didn't anticipate a few things about the new house.  Our doorknob safety covers were not a good fit for the shape of the knobs in the new house.  She was able to manipulate and open the new doors right away, as the handles were smaller and sleeker inside the cover.  After trial and error of several different types of safety covers, I went to Home Depot and bought the same style of knobs we had in our apartment and spent all day Saturday changing out fifteen total doors in our house.\n\n24 hours and she figured out how to open those as well.  She has been obsessed with going into the bathrooms and messing with the tubs and sinks, we have three bathrooms and it's just a constant *\"Where's the kid?\"* situation around here.  She will sit outside of a bathroom door waiting for us to look the other way.  We have found her dropping items in the toilet, running the tub, under the sink.  Very dangerous in terms of possible hot water and flooding.  We could install tall latches on the outside of those doors, but our other kids frequently use the bathrooms and this would keep them out as well.  This will become another problem when she realizes we have a basement with an open sump pump, wash basin, and all manner of utilities she could get into and disrupt, turn a valve.  Same for the doorway to the garage, full of lawn tools.  \n\nNot to mention our exterior doors and we couldn't find a house without an open floor plan, so when the stove is on and you're the only parent home, you have to hold your bladder until another parent can relieve you.  \n\nI work from home 50\/50 and my wife works from home full time time.  \n\nWe are getting almost nothing done here and it's hard to work, constantly dealing with daughter.  We had 1 bathroom and a gate on our tiny kitchen in the apartment.

A little background:\n\nMy daughter is 13 months old. I noticed some differences with her around 6-7 months (I have other kids, so I know all kids move at different speeds). However, I started to noticed she wasn\u2019t reaching her milestones and was exhibiting behaviors I\u2019m not really familiar with.\n\nNow I\u2019m curious, could she be autistic. \n\n-She doesn\u2019t respond to her name \/ or people talking to her in general. She was referred to get a hearing screening but failed both. Now she\u2019s scheduled for \u201csurgery\u201d in January to have another hearing screening where she\u2019ll be sedated (abr hearing screening). \n-She doesn\u2019t hold eye contact, the longest I can get her to look at me is like 3 seconds. Sometimes she avoids eye contact all together.\n-She doesn\u2019t walk yet and can barely crawl. She\u2019s been in PT for a while because she had a flat head and torticollis. So she was going for that but now PT helps with strengthening her muscles and we are working on crawling. (She can pull herself up but when she does she bounces on her tip toes and her feet are turned inwards). We are now getting her SMOs to help with this.\n-She constantly rocks\/bangs head, jumps, twirls\/pulls hair, covers eyes, point to nothing in general, shakes her head \u201cno\u201d, again, nothing in general, just does it. I don\u2019t know if these behaviors are related to autism but as the days go on, she does it more frequently. The rocking\/head banging is my BIGGEST concern. She does it SO much and it can be annoying (and I feel bad it annoys me). She does it in her walker, playpen, high chair, sitting up, everywhere!!\n-She doesn\u2019t say words. She used to say \u201cdada\u201d but stopped a few months ago. She mostly screams or fuses when she wants my attention.\n-She still drinks milk and will only eat certain pur\u00e9es. As I mentioned, she\u2019s 13 months and her pediatrician mentioned she hasn\u2019t gained weight since 9 months and she won\u2019t really eat anything else.\n-She doesn\u2019t really interact with her siblings or me. She mostly prefers to be alone. She will let me cuddle her for like 3 seconds, but tends to pull\/push away. \n-She has a developmental therapist and she often speaks about sensory. I don\u2019t really understand what that is all about. I know she often keeps a soft blanket near my daughter for when she starts her rocking and try to rub that on her or leg squeezes \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n-She\u2019s not really interested in toys (even ones that should appeal to her according to her therapist).\n\nI feel like I\u2019m missing a thing here or there, but for the most part this is my everyday life with my daughter. Is this normal? Any tips???! \n\n(She\u2019s in Early Intervention, btw.

Hope it's ok but I need to talk about it for the sake of my own mental health.\n\nSo, my sister is autistic (26F, high-functioning but temperamental) and my mom (60F) and I (23F) have been trying really hard to find her a job for about 2 years now. She (my sister) has been 'working' on and off with various training programs but can't seem to secure a job, which I'm increasingly worried about. This is because my parents aren't getting younger and I want my sister to be able to become independent and find some meaningful work in life. I don't mind taking care of her if I have to but the main goal is to get her to live a life worth living for rather than stay home and do nothing. \n\nHowever, through interacting with so many social enterprises without anything to show for it has made me very jaded towards their proclaimed intentions to help and uplift autistic persons. This recent issue though, has broken the camel's back.\n\nMy sister recently finished an F&B training program and according to the trainer's feedback, she did everything right. She did have some feedback with regards to her behaviour, though - she can be quite temperamental, and loves giving people nicknames (they're not meant to be offensive) but she's generally harmless and was just having fun. One of the other trainees unfortunately did not like her 'given nickname' and had trouble controlling her emotions, which we understood and tried to get her (my sister) to stop doing that. This bit of info will come in later.\n\nSo after final evaluations following the training program, my sister landed a potential (seemingly confirmed, or so we thought) job opportunity from a cafe owner who had been observing the training process. My mom accompanied her to the interview where things went ok, though my sister did have a small meltdown but the employer seemed to be understanding to her condition. They told my mom they would be interested in hiring her and 'see how things go', setting her up for a training schedule at the cafe for the following week (Week 1). The week comes around, no response and my mom messages and they reply, saying they were busy with new menu drafts so they would have to push back the job training for my sister (Week 2). The next week comes around, still no response or updates. My mom messages again, they said they're training 2 other new staff members and will have to postpone another week (Week 3). Week 3 rolls around, my mom then messages for a third time - and now, they say they are unable to hire my sister because of personality clashes with one of their new employees (one of the 2 they were training in week 2) - the one my sister was 'teasing' and didn't like her 'given nickname'.\n\n**What this pisses me off is that**\n\n1) My sister was supposed to start in week 1 but got kicked aside for someone who started in week 2\n\n2) the false hope given (she should have told us way sooner if she never planned to hire my sister in the first place, we even rejected another offer for this job that obviously never ended up happening), promising that they're fine to take on my sister and give her a chance but ultimately dodging the responsibility they initially seemed ready to accept\n\n3) if the employer had observed their training program and wanted to hire her, she would have seen my sister at work and how she interacts with the other party. Thus, such an excuse on how they can't hire her anymore due to the new employees potentially being 'sworn enemies' (the employer actually used this term, what a joke) is completely ridiculous. If my sister started as she should have started working in Week 1, would they have used the same ridiculous excuse on the other party? This just isn't fair. \n\nThis whole situation kills me. It really does. My sister was looking so forward to it and has really shown considerable effort to try to control her own behaviour and do her work well only for this to happen. It's just so disappointing. My heart hurts for her and my mom. I want her to live a meaningful life with gainful employment but it just seems like so much bad luck and an abundance of sketchy social enterprises. My parents are not getting younger and though I do not mind taking over the caretaking in the future, I want them to retire comfortably and for my sister to at least be able to marginally support herself.\n\nAfter so many run-ins with such terrible experiences (i.e. ghosting, firing her after ONE small meltdown), do social enterprises actually care? Or are they looking to hire autistic persons because they are seen as more easily 'controlled' or 'dispensible'? Are they truly accepting of autism because it sure doesn't seem like it when they can't even seem to handle basic behavioural deviations.\n\nTLDR: Social enterprises claim to want to help but often do not and are primarily self-interested. They try to present themselves as altruistic but often succeed in doing exactly the opposite of that. They are beacons of false hope with absolutely no real intention to help persons with autism and ought to be extremely ashamed of themselves.

He is currently in a private special needs school with a small classroom of only 6 kids total. He is a funny, bright kid who has his special interests (currently on a HUGE dinosaur kick) and can be stubborn wrt doing schoolwork as and when he is required to. He is currently in Grade R (basically the reception year in my country) and should be going to grade 1 next year, but I doubt he will go into grade 1.\n\nThe curriculum at his school is VERY outcomes based. But I am finding that there seems to be very little accommodation of his intuitive learning style. He is learning and is doing really well in my opinion, but there are certain things that the curriculum requires that he is just NOT interested in, for example colouring in pictures, cutting and pasting, and certain arts and crafts. So I'm just a bit stumped as to how to help him going forward...I realised that myself and his dad could try better to link learning activities to his special interests, but the school is not going to do that (on a large scale). I guess my concern is just that he is going to fall way way behind in schooling just because he isn't interested in the activities they offer him.\n\nAny advice? Any experience to share?

Teacher believes my kid is on spectrum, evaluators not so sure... Is she just mirroring me?? (Autistic parent of one female child) ","selftext":"Hi! I am parent of just one kiddo, a female child in 1st grade. Her teacher is very kind and knowledgeable, she has experience teaching special education in the past, and seems to very much care for my daughter. She has brought up to me that she has seen signs from my kiddo that makes her believe I should get her evaluated; specifically her refusal to deviate from her \"rules\" \/ way of doing things, and she gets quite upset if things go \"wrong\" or if something unexpected happens. She also is quite advanced and gets very bored, she reads entire chapter books to herself and makes flashcards of the periodic table of elements and doesn't understand why they must do sheetwork with the same type of problems over and over and over; this leads to her losing interest in her work, or zooming through it so fast that her handwriting looks very poor. \n\n\nFirst, her teacher asked if it would be okay to set her up with a counselor to talk to during school, and I said absolutely! After that, we got a call from a behavioral health center (which I also attend for PTSD and I'm on the spectrum myself) which surprised me, as I assumed it would he a school counselor type of thing; not a behavioral health center. Either way, I took her in--- we felt very out of place, as the other children there were visibly having trouble sitting still and were very loud. This made my kid feel slightly afraid, but I explained to her that they're just bored of waiting and have the wiggles, it'll be okay, and she felt happy and waited politely. \n\n\n\nWhen my daughter was finally seen, she asked the therapist doing the evaluation if she could play a puzzle game with me, which we did happily together while she and I sat still and answered all necessary questions. The therapist asked what issues I noted at home, and I said well...honestly, she's awesome at home but she's also an only child, and I'm a stay at home parent so I'm there 24\/7 for her; it's her teacher that noted issues at school that I haven't often seen at home or possibly didn't notice because I display the same behaviors?? I explained her issues of refusal to \"move on\" when something goes wrong, her tendency not wanting to stray from routine, sensitivity to things like people cussing, people yelling, being hurt (even small scrapes), and being extremely empathetic to other people's pain to the point that it'll cause HER to cry if she hurt someone's feelings or if she sees someone else in pain. \n\n\n\n\nThe therapist asked questions such as \"Has she experienced violence?\" No, we don't spank let alone raise our voice at her. \"Has she hit other children\/ acted in violent ways?\" Never. She's a bit sensitive and will cry or raise her voice, but NEVER has she ever hit or thrown things. \"Has she ever shown delays with milestones?\" No, she was an early talker and early reader, and has always been the top of her class... yet also the most *sensitive*. At the end of it, she put her notes down and looked at me and said \"So, how serious are you about getting her in here? Cuz I'd have to diagnose her with something, and I just can't see a match. From what I've seen, she's perfect. I've seen a lot of gifted children that are highly sensitive, and I have a feeling this is just her personality type. I'm going to deny you today, but please come back if you feel that anything changes or you see escalating behaviors. She's an awesome kid, and you do great supporting her needs.\" \n\n\n\n\nI asked if they are qualified to diagnosed ASD in children, and they said no....which I already kinda guessed, because I attend the adult center next door which doesn't test for ASD either. The next day, I gave the denial paper to her teacher, to which she said \"Really? They denied her?\" And I said yes, but they only evaluate for behavioral health issues like anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, ADHD etc etc which she didn't qualify for, and I told her the type of questions they asked which my child didn't fit the profile of. I then mentioned to her teacher that they wouldn't test for something like ASD, which is the same issue I had as a kid-- I was a GATE (gifted and talented education) student that had no trouble socializing but I preferred being alone and had \"different\" behaviors that didn't fit in with any typical behavioral health issues so they were at a loss... also being female in the 90s they didn't realize that Autistic girls present differently, I was told I just \"walked like a little ballerina\" when I toe-walked, and was called \"rude\" or \"cold\" whenever I had poor eye contact and disliked being forced to hug others. She agreed, and said \"I had another male student last year I suspected was on the spectrum and they had to jump through hoops. You'll have to start with a doctor visit and ask for a referral for her... has her doctor said anything?\" And, again, it's annoying because her doctor said basically the exact same thing and even used the same phrase-- \"she's perfect\" (whatever that means).\n\n\n\nI'm afraid that my child's high intelligence and ability to socialize and be SUPER friendly\/ insanely funny keep professionals from seeing the part of her where she's not so \"perfect\" --- she's able to \"fit in\" with NTs until something doesn't go as expected, and the melt downs begin... I think the issue is at home I know her sooo well in and out so I can shut that behavior down easily, but others like her teacher don't know her like I do and it turns into an issue. They also do not have GATE program at my daughter's school, and nothing is offered for gifted \/ creative children like her... the school has some of the lowest test scores I've ever seen, and this area is very low income (including us) so resources and support are quite hard to find. \n\n\n\n\n\nHas anyone else gone through something similar? Part of me fears that she's just mimicking MY behaviors, and that's why she fits in soooo well socially but then has these odd little quirks that are seen as being quite \"unusual\". I'm kind of afraid I accidentally taught her to mirror me, and now it's causing issues at school. :( for example, her tendency to line things up and the DEMAND that things should be put away in rainbow order definitely came from me.

Decided to start trying with my 26 month old son. Honestly, not because I thought he'd get it down, but because I feel like he will need months of practice. He also has ARFID and we can't really even get him to not be afraid of all solid foods. He is in speech and OT, his only says 1 word. But this whole experience has shown he absolutely does not like being told what to do. I don't know how to explain it other than that. I did not expect him to have it figured out, but he has all the signs he hates his diaper and wants nothing to do with it anymore.\n\nHe has all of the \"signs\" we should try potty training. He hates being in his wet diaper and will get frustrated and cry until you change him. however, he will also launch himself backwards because he hates getting changed! It says online, if your kid fights being changed, it may be time to try potty training. We got 2 different potties. We learned quickly he will not sit on either one of them and has a tantrums....ok...We try the toilet. He's ok sitting there but we need to find constant distractions. He is extremely active and never stops running around all day so keeping him still is hard. He will not go at all and will hold his pee or poo, get off the toilet, then go on the floor. Or, he goes to one of his toy boxes and tries to sit in it, then pees. He may sneak off to the corner, squat down and show these signs he needs to go, but just will not use the toilet.\n\nSo we have then had to change him over and over and now that has turned into him not even wanting us to touch him or take his wet clothes off, him running away, not allowing us to guide him by his hand or pick him up without him kicking and screaming or turning his body to jello. His noises and hand flapping has increased this last week because he's stressed. He was very happy and excited at first to be out of the diapers! But seems miserable now. He goes to the daycare and had 3 accidents the first day back...I thought that was good. Daycare was mad. The next day he had 7 accidents. the next, 6, but would have been 5 if husband picked up him up at his usual time. Today, they clearly didn't relaly want him there. \n\n I don't know, I don't know where to go with this from here.

{"post_type":"s","created_utc":1730139830.0,"subreddit":"Autism_Parenting","author":"chantellschmahl","link_flair":"Advice Needed","title":"Need some encouragement","selftext":"Hello everyone, this is my first post here so please excuse if it's not quite right.\n\nMy son just turned 3 on 8 October. He's an only child. Pregnancy went well apart from a stint with gestational diabetes and having Covid twice. His birth and first couple of months were easy. Most days are great too. He met all of his milestones, started talking at 1.5 years, potty trained in 3 days in March (without any of those harsh methods), is kind, caring and loving. He's now learning English as it's our second language over here. He's also a very beautiful boy, so people are just drawn to him.\n\nBUT...\n\nAt around 3 months he started crying every night between 6 and 9. It was extremely hard on my husband and I. At 5 months we took him to an OT and he was diagnosed with sensory sensitivity. He didn't like the text book sleep hygiene environment. Once we stopped making everything dark and quite he never cried again. Sensitivities are so much better.\n\nAt 6 months we introduced food, but until about a year ago he was a \"difficult\" eater. Not picky, just not very \"eaty\". Once we took his bottle away at age 2, he started eating more. But won't smash a plate of food like his peers do.\n\nAt 9 months he was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called Van Der Woude Syndrome (which my mom and I also found out we had). He has a submucous cleft palate so his pronunciation is a bit underdeveloped, but the speech therapist isn't too concerned yet.\n\nWhen he started walking at around 1, he did walk on his toes for a bit, but hasn't for a long time.\n\nI haven't seen signs of stimming, but maybe I just don't know exactly what to look for. Is being neat and tidy (not necessarily lining up, but arranging) stimming?\n\nDespite being sociable, we've been told he tends to withdraw from his peers at school at times. He'd rather sit and \"daydream\" than run around.\n\nHe's very curious, opinionated, strong-willed and prone to meltdowns when things don't go his way. Sometimes in public.\n\nHe enjoys water play heaps, but doesn't splash excessively. \n\nHe absolutely LOVES fans, heaters and windmills (of which we have many around where we live). He started staring at ceiling fans at around 4 months. Now, with his vast collection of spinning things, he doesn't stare at them, but loves switching them on and off, plugging them in and out, arranging them, carrying them everywhere, talking about them and even sleeping with them. He also loves watching fan videos online and talking about which ones he wants, which ones are broken, etc.\n\nIn February of this year the OT found a catch in left arm and leg. Our leading pediatric neurologist saw him and informed us that he had a perinatal stroke at 10 weeks in utero, and is now classified as having cerebral palsy. Yet a leading pediatric physiotherapist couldn't see any negative physical effects. Despite this, he's not a running, jumping, climbing boy.\n\nI also asked the neurologist about my son possibly having autism or being neurodivergent, but he said he's not. When asked about the fans over balls and dogs, he said if he seems a little \"weird\" (we didn't take offence to the language used as the neurologist is also neurodivergent), it's just the stroke and sensory sensitivity it caused, and that he'd grow out of it eventually. He said to embrace his quirks, such as his love of fans.\n\nMy psychologist says he doesn't sound autistic either, but not to lean into his fan obsession. She gives me advice on how to parent the unique child that he is.\n\nBut it's hard. As I know it is for everyone. And I do realise that many parents have it much harder.\n\nI guess my question is, what's your opinion? Does he sound like a unique but neurotypical 3 year old? Should we seek more medical advice? Should I be concerned or chill out? Or just wait for the ball to drop?\n\nJust don't want the persecution from family for being concerned anymore, and hoping to find kindness and compassion here.\n\nThanks for your time.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1ge98rd\/need_some_encouragement\/","main_id":"1ge98rd","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-28 18:23:50"}

I had a tough time in secondary school, and the idea of sending my child into that kind of environment where they might struggle with subjects they aren\u2019t passionate about or face social pressures has been daunting. But as I\u2019ve learned more about special schools here in the UK, I've started to find comfort. They often provide a stable, supportive environment from Year 1 through Year 13, almost like a second home. They can focus on functional skills and give kids a safe, nurturing space over many years, which brings me some unexpected peace of mind.\n\nLooking further, I\u2019m realizing there are other silver linings for us. It\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll get into risky behaviors like joining gangs or experimenting with substances. He may not be out late or unsupervised, which means fewer worries about certain dangers, like being bullied, mugged, or pressured into things like drinking. He may also be less interested in the expensive afterschool clubs or things like football that involve standing in the rain on muddy fields! Plus, he may live with us long-term, so there won\u2019t be concerns about the housing market or car expenses.\n\nOf course, I know there\u2019s a lot I won\u2019t experience as other parents might, and there are things he may miss out on, too. But in reframing things this way, I\u2019m finding positives I hadn\u2019t anticipated. The school aspect especially brings me comfort\u2014it\u2019s a much safer and more compassionate environment than the one I grew up in. I can\u2019t imagine being a kid today with social media and phones everywhere.\n\nAnyone else have similar reflections or thoughts on this?

So I'm not looking for the \"everyone is different\" or \"you can't really predict that\" comments. I'm simply trying to gather some anecdotal evidence or data from parents with children who are very similar to mine. \n\nSo: My son was diagnosed with Level 2 ASD when he was 23 months old. He is currently just over 2\u00bd, he's nonverbal, he's a sensory seeker, and he's a very happy, affectionate kid. He elopes sometimes when the current situation doesn't hold his interest, and he's moderately picky about food, but honestly neither of those things extend beyond the scope of what I think you'd see with any other toddler his age. (I was a preschool teacher for years before I was a parent, and so was my mom for my entire life, so I think my experience with kids gives some credit to my accumulated anecdotal evidence.)\n\nAside from the things stated above, he doesn't really exhibit the myriad of other traits that are generally associated with autism, like rigidity with play or schedule, atypical aggression or anxiety, insomnia, etc. Outside of his moderate stimming and toe walking when he needs to regulate, plus him being nonverbal, he's not really that different to other kids his age. \n\n[side note before the angry comments flood in: there's nothing wrong with a child presenting any of the traits I stated above. I'm just trying to provide context for exactly how my son's autism presents, so that I can reach the people I'm trying to find with this post.]\n\n If you also had a young child who was a nonverbal sensory seeker, but was otherwise pretty on par with their peers, did they ever start to talk? At what age? Do you think there were contributing factors, such as putting them into daycare\/school? I'm basically just trying to find other parents whose child had the nonverbal, sensory seeking \"type\" of autism, like mine, and ask if\/when they ever started to talk.\n\n(I know that that isn't really a medically recognized \"type\" of autism, so please don't be offended or upset by my word choices. I'm just trying to narrow down the spectrum a bit to find similar kids to mine and gather some anecdotal evidence.)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1gem0lw\/question_about_talking\/","main_id":"1gem0lw","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-29 04:03:02"}

My partner handled the kids and the house, I went to work and cooked dinner 3 nights a week, handling the bedtime tasks when I would get home and it was bliss. Then I stupidly suggested my partner practice self care, because being the primary care taker can be hard and we all need a hobby. For him it came in the form of skateboarding, a decades long hobby.

But when the day finally came, the guest list of people who promised they\u2019d be there dwindled down to almost no one.\n \nMy sister and her daughter couldn\u2019t come because they were sick, and I understood completely; sometimes life throws us curveballs. But no one else showed up. Not a single other family member or friend. It hurt. I\u2019m already an isolated person, and as someone recently diagnosed with autism, I\u2019m only beginning to understand how that isolation is a big part of my life. Therapy has been helping me see the layers of my own coping mechanisms, like how my husband and I tend to isolate ourselves because it feels safer. He\u2019s also gone no-contact with his family, so that leaves us with just my family around for support\u2014and in this case, even that was thin.\n \nThe hardest part of this experience wasn\u2019t just my disappointment, but the fear that my struggles could affect my son. As a parent, the idea that my own challenges might prevent him from feeling the love and connection he deserves cuts me deep. I wanted his day to be special, a moment where he felt celebrated.\n \nThankfully, his grandma and PopPop were there. They showed up with all the enthusiasm and love I could\u2019ve hoped for, and that meant the world to me. My son had a blast with them; he didn\u2019t notice who was missing.

So we always thought (and others always commented) that he was in some way \"gifted\".\n\nAs a baby he basically never slept. Awake 18 hour a a day. This changed about 1 year in and now sleeps like a dream.\n\nUntil he was about 18 months, he only wanted his mum. Hated being held by anyone else. Got scared when strangers\/other family members spoke to him.\n\nThis all changed (a complete 180) when his little brother was born and he was no longer the centre of attention. Now, he's extremely socially forward and engages people, anyone, strangers or family members, but in a very \"full on\" way.\n\nHe has always hand flapped when excited. He hyperfixates on things for a few weeks then moves on to a new \"obsession\". It could be windturbines, fireplaces, moana, a certain book, chickens, etc. \n\nHe's always been sensitive, as was I as a child. This morning he got super upset about a string of cotton on his t shirt and then wouldn't eat his breakfast because of it.\n\nHe used to love the park, slides, swings, but about 6 months ago out of the blue started avoiding\/refusing to go on anything like that.\n\nHe used to have meltdowns when it rained, but also meltdowns if we tried to put his hood up\/hat on.\n\nThankfully he now loves hoods and hats, after we told him he looks like spiderman with his hood up (he can definitely \"get over\" things if we word it in a way that appeals to him).\n\nHe's extremely bright for his age. Everyone comments on how clever he is, but his motor skills are clumsy as best. As mentioned he definitely hand flaps for the entire song\/video He's listening to\/watching\/during being read to.\n\nHis nursery also think he may have adhd (I know there can be a lot of crossover with autism\/adhd\/ocd\/spd etc).\n\nHe prefers adult company even though the kids at his nursery all love him, it's almost like he doesn't even know they are there for the majority of the time. \n\nHe bursts into song when meeting kids outside of nursery, never says hello or any kind of usual interaction, it's always straight into song really close to their face, or talking 100 miles an hour about a book they don't know about, lol.\n\nI don't know why I'm posting this, but my wife just rang me upset about it all, and she's more worried than I am about it, which upsets me.\n\nAgain, he's super super smart, but is extremely sensitive, hand flaps, has lots of quirks, but also has a great sense of humour, ahead with all things like letters, shapes, numbers, remembers everything, every word in a book, but gets very upset if you get one word out of order or wrong, and makes us start again.\n\nHe can definitely get over certain triggers, but it has to be handled in a creative way that appeals to him.\n\nIf anyone has any advice or a similar child, please comment.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this.\n\nEdit:\nI (his dad) have ocd, and tactile (clothing mainly) issues, and his mum has some social anxiety\/self diagnosed spd (loud noises, busy places etc), although most people would assume we don't have any issues at all.

The point of this question isn't about whether or not she has autism, but rather to find the best ways to handle a shut down from a child that has autism when it is important to talk about a situation that happened. With her being our niece rather than our child, we obviously have a lot less we can actively do to help, but we are worried because her parents don't seem to know what to do and they don't seem to be taking this seriously. \n\nThe main issue is that she has started telling other kids at school violent threats. Of course threats need to be taken seriously, but we sincerely believe she doesn't intend to act on them, and is just mirroring behavior she sees in the world. She is getting suspended from school because of this as well. The point here isn't so much about the behavior itself, but more about how to talk to her about what is going on, why she is saying these things, etc. When she does something that she can tell is taken to be \"wrong\" by other people, she has a tendency to completely shut down. She stops talking and responding, even if the conversation is brought up days later. We are worried and want to be able to give her a safe space to open up about what she might be feeling, but getting past this \"shut down\" has been impossible. We don't want her to suffer alone, and her parents are just brushing it off as \"kids being kids.\" As I mentioned before, we suspect she may be on the spectrum from a variety of behaviors, so I am seeking advice on how parents typically handle this sort of \"shut down\" behavior with their children on the spectrum in a gentle way that has the child's best interest as a priority.

Having children is hard, but having a ND high needs child while also being ND is just. I'm tired.\n\nTl;dr teacher says my autistic child has done well with school and no known issues at new daycare, but has meltdowns and behavior issues at home. Is this normal for autistic children and how do I help my child transition from school to home? Will ABA therapy help with this?\n\nMy 4 year old was finally diagnosed with Autism level 2 and ADHD in April. This was a long expected diagnosis. They also said he has global developmental delay and developmental language disorder. I had him initially evaluated at a different place at 2 because of frequent tantrums, sleep regression that never went away, repetitive behaviors (hand flapping, wheel spinning, watching the same show over and over), little interest in playing with other children, poor eye contact, and speech issues. He wouldn't respond to his name most of the time, and wouldn't point or follow where someone was pointing. He was still highly verbal and interactive, even though his speech wasn't well understood, but he was meeting milestones. Even with the red flags, he wasn't diagnosed then. They said he was possibly adhd, but too young to diagnose, and he didn't need speech therapy bc he was still within range of a normal 2 year old. I was left kind of relieved initially, but still frustrated bc he continued to struggle and I knew all this wasn't normal.\nHe's gone to daycare full-time consistently since about 18 months, and he had behavior issues, but I kind of attributed a lot of it to bad daycares. The first daycare was inattentive, staff always on their phones, letting the 2 year olds sit and watch tv most of the day in a dark room, would give my son candy literally anytime he fussed. He learned a lot of bad habits there. We moved last June and changed daycares. This one was good initially, he liked the teacher. Then they moved him up to a new classroom for potty trained children, even though we were still potty training, and he had at least 5 teachers from that time until he left. It was like a rotating door of caregivers and he didn't like many of them. He had behavior problems there, and was generally viewed as a problem child and \"difficult to manage\", he would hit other kids for taking his toys out of his hands, the staff would play super loud music in the classroom causing sensory overload and behavior problems, he wouldn't sit still, and he was difficult to get down for naps. Several times, I would have to take extended lunches to come get him down for a nap or calm him down and they would often call and ask me to pick him up bc they didn't want to deal with him. I tried to work with them, scheduled meetings and had many phone calls over it, which on two different occations, the director would blame me and tell me \"I wasn't spanking him enough\", she also hung up on me once. I tried to find a new daycare bc I knew they couldn't give him the care he needed, but there were no openings anywhere. He eventually started peeing in inappropriate places, like beside the director's desk and on the playground, which I know was a defiant behavior due to how he was being treated there. He never did it outside of daycare and didn't continue it afterwards. They called a \"safety issue\" and he was kicked out. His daycare he attends now has been great overall. \nLast October, at the daycare he was later kicked out of, they noticed the W sitting, which he's done since he was a year old, and noted on his sensory differences, so I got a referral for an OT eval., and a referral to get another eval for Autism. At OT, he was diagoosed with SPD, but he was still meeting age appropriate milestones so they decided he didn't need occupational therapy, which I thought was weird. \nHe started pre-k this year and started a new daycare the same time and goes there after school. We had the initial meeting for his IEP for school in August and should finally set it up next month. I didn't know it would take so long or if that's normal. I'm still on the wait list for ABA therapy. The initial recommendation was for 15 hours a week, but the school won't allow anyone to come in to do it there, and he isn't in after-school care for the minimum 3 hours required. I found a place who will let him do 4 hour sessions 2 days a week, I'll just have to drive a ways to do it. All this to say, getting care for my child has been challenging and time consuming. Even aside from the hurdles to get an official diagnosis, I'm still waiting for him to get the help he needs. I've had to be really proactive and learn how to advocate for him.\nHe had some behavior issues in school at first, but seems to be doing much better. The problem is, he has started saying that he doesn't like school and doesn't want to go. I'll ask if he had a good day, and he'll say \"yes!\" but then he frowns and says school makes him sad, he says they make him sit on the coloring mat and he gets in trouble when he gets up (they let him color or do puzzles when they have lessons bc he cannot sit still. Even though not watching, he still listens to everything being said and answers questions, he just has to be activitely doing something to keep him occupied) he says the kids also make him sad, but he loves his teacher. He doesn't really elaborate on why he is sad at school, he just says he doesn't like it. He has come a long way with communicating and his speech has improved so much even in the past few months. He will verbally express when he has big emotions, but he's not really good at being able to tell me why all the time. I do wonder if he is learning to mask at school to fit in and how hard this has been on him.  \nThe biggest issue right now is transitioning in the mornings and evenings. He cries many mornings at drop off and is resistant when getting up and ready. He often has trouble falling asleep and has a hard time waking up. When he wakes up, he immediately asks if he has school today and when I say yes, he gets upset, saying he doesn't want to go. When I check in with the teacher and let her know he's having a hard time, she says he is doing great with no problems (other than sometimes not napping) and sends me pictures of him smiling and happy. \nBut when I pick him up from daycare, he sometimes  just falls apart.. sometimes he's overstimulated and will have really bad tantrums, yelling, crying, throwing and kicking everything he can find, causing a mess. Alternatively, he will be happy and chatty, and then suddenly fall asleep and I can't wake him up for hours. He gets upset if I don't immediately give him wants, and he doesn't like to wait for things, ie candy, sweets, among other things, although it's getting better and I'm teaching patience. Often, if I say no and try to redirect him, he will fuss about it and not let it go. Reasoning goes out the window. He will sometimes say \"fine, I'll get it myself\" and try to do so, leading to time outs. He's bad about getting into a loop of repeating himself over and over. He is a vocal stimmer, belting out songs and phrases, yelling, squealing, generally a lot of disruptive sensory seeking behaviors, says inappropriate words like poop at the end of sentences to be silly. It's sometimes a sign that he's anxious or disregulated. The biggest trigger lately for him is he wants to immediately get out of the car and look for bugs, his current obsession. Everywhere we go now, he wants to stop and do this. It takes up much of his time. We have a pet cob web spider, seriously, and he catches bugs to feed it. Sometimes, I can stand and look with him for a bit when we get home, but usually I need to go inside to change and feed the baby. He can't be left alone as he has no sense of danger and will wander off into the road. He used to have a really bad problem with eloping and it terrifies me. He really can't be left unattended for any amount of time because he has very impulsive behaviors. I have a fenced in back yard and I tell him we can go there after I tend to baby, and we can get a snack etc, but he won't budge. I try to communicate on the way home what the plan is and be really positive and give him clear directions, but he is pretty rigid and defiant and it usually leads to me eventually having to be like okay we have to go in and I have to pick him up and carry baby and him in each arm inside, with him kicking and screaming. Also, when we come home, his face and hands are always covered in dirt. I'm not sure if they wash them at daycare or if he doesn't let them? So he knows we need to wash them when we get home before he can eat, etc, I talk about germs and not getting sick and he understands and agrees, but he will protest hand washing and it's almost always a struggle to get him to do anything if he doesn't want to do it. Even if he's agreeable about something, he often loses focus and gets distracted, so keeping him on task is difficult. Once he's inside, the tantrum subsides, he adjusts to being home, and he's fine, but it's a struggle more times than not.\nHe really likes to do a lot of things by himself and is doing well self care like brushing his own teeth(he fought it for years if anyone else tries to brush them so it's a relief that he can do it by himself now), undressing, and toileting but if he doesn't want to do something, I end up spending a lot of time trying to talk him into it or end up just having to do it for him or force him, especially if there are time constraints, which causes a lot of distress on both ends. I've gotten pretty good at hyping him up, giving him choices, and talking him down from his meltdowns, but it's really difficult to keep a routine bc I never know if he's going to be cool with it or detest it from one day to the next and it'sso time consumingjust to do daily tasks. I knew both school and after school care would be an adjustment, but I wonder what I might could do differently to help him transition better or if he will just always be like this.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1gf5ubi\/audhd_child_in_school\/","main_id":"1gf5ubi","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-29 21:19:45"}

Right now and for the last almost half a year he constantly spits, while pushing air out of his lips almost like blowing a \u201craspberry\u201d but with less vibration and noise by his lips. \n\nIt\u2019s clearly a new stim because he flaps and jumps in place while doing so and even spits while focusing on dribbling a ball and playing with shiny ribbons. It\u2019s like focusing makes it worse sometimes. \n\nI can\u2019t seem to find much information out anywhere but it\u2019s so bad that the school has laminated a paper saying spitting is bad, spitting is yucky, my classmates don\u2019t like when I spit. Etc.\n\nIt\u2019s unsanitary and my fianc\u00e9 and I are constantly cleaning the floors and walls.\n\nAny tips would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAnother issue that is huge for him that seems to be a first for anyone we talk to about it is his issue with eating. He goes into a full panic and investigative mode to inspect your mouth to see if you were chewing on something and it literally makes him instantly start to cry and melt down to the maximum if he catches someone eating. For example the school bus driver was chewing gum and it caused a melt down on the way home from school. It\u2019s so bad that he thinks that I am chewing on something when I\u2019m just trying to lay down and he repeatedly keeps trying to pull my hand and get me up so he can see my cheeks look less fat \/ full of food when I stand up and it\u2019s clear my mouth doesn\u2019t have food in it.\n\nI can even open my mouth to show him I\u2019m not chewing on anything and then when I close my mouth again he thinks I was hiding something somewhere and am chewing again. Like he doesn\u2019t want me to lay with him because he always thinks if I\u2019m resting I\u2019m eating because of how it makes my cheeks look.\n\nOnce again this doesn\u2019t seem to be a common problem and the info I can find is seldom and doesn\u2019t seem to be the same.

I handled it on my own and learned everything I could on my own and got him to a place where he understands his emotions and how to handle things that cause him frustration. He still struggles but is doing great in the grand scheme of things.

We got him evaluated for ASD and he does not meet criteria at this point . We are bilingual and he has only been exposed to English at school (8:30-12 PM ) for one full year and also been around kids of his age for this time . He doesn't have any other social exposure to anyone except for me at home . My husband is generally busy and is hardly around . As a 16 month old he used to love numbers and alphabets and kept running around the house reciting the ABC song and would practice writing the alphabets and numbers . He had a functional speech and would ask me whatever he wanted and show us things. He used to be somewhat a serious child and not laughing out loud at silly things. He would laugh and smile for things that were funny sorta like how a matured kid would do and not for the baby-ish stuff . If you know what I mean . He met all his milestones on time . He continued to play with alphabets and numbers forming spellings , lining them up and writing on a writing board etc . At 3 , he was very verbal and every answer was sensible and he was also asking the right questions and his focus shifted to cars . He started taking interest in the make , model , logo , number plates etc . He was communicating well but had limited eye contact with anyone outside of the family . He also started going to preschool at 3 yrs and 9 months. Academically he was the most advanced . He could do addition , subtraction , read any books and could also comprehend and answer questions but at that point he only knew our mother tongue well. So , the social aspect of the language was missing and we thought he would learn that at school . It  took him about a month to adjust and then he was doing well overall but was very serious in class . Was focused on his work and was not playful . A few months later he did a complete 180 and started socializing very well with all the boys in class. Towards the end of the year , he started imitating this one kid that was the highest energy and did inappropriate things . But it wasn't anything major . \n\nFrom the past one year , he was mostly shown only car reviews by my husband and he got 1 hr of screentime each week and he would watch Genevieve's play house on it . \n\nHis interest in cars continued through the summer and he would keep drawing cars all day , build Lego cars  and also play with hot wheels cars while making engine noise . \nAlso , he would make different noises like clicking sounds ,  humming some songs  while playing alone  which were very cute and my husband would call beat boxing . He always says he likes making music . \n\nStarting this school year in August , his teachers started complaining that he is copying another high energy kid and having a hard time playing with the other kids . They also said he would cry if he did not get blue paper or crayon to draw . He would also only make eye contact if the teachers spoke about cars and not otherwise . So I asked his pediatrician to refer us for an evaluation . The Psychologist took inputs from us and his teachers prior to in person evaluation . The evaluation happened and he did not meet criteria. She said he was reserved but also very social , shared things spontaneously , gave appropriate answers z reacted appropriately and did not indulge in any repetitive behavior or showed any restricted interest.  She attributed much of his social difficulties to lack of English language exposure , lack of social exposure in early years and his high intelligence (based on cognitive test) which might make it difficult for him to form friendships at this age . \n\nI spoke to his teacher today and she said he no longer talks only about cars . He is also giving a lot more eye contact . He is trying to be friends with all the boys ,  but is also indulging himself in a lot of silly plays and when his friends talk about poop he also does (which the teacher is mad about ) . At home he insists that he wants to learn about mickey mouse and bugs because his friends like them and that he can have something to talk to them about . His clicking noises have reduced to a huge extent and also he has been playing a variety of pretend play , talking about various things and showing interest in a variety of things . \n\nI am not sure what to do next ! Was he misdiagnosed or is his preschool teacher being too picky about everything he does? ( I know she only means good to us and our family !)\n\nThe evaluation costed us $2000 and we cannot afford to get it done again . \n\nAny suggestions or advice ?

I have an 8yo boy that after years of suspecting, we finally have the diagnosis of Autism, ADHD and ARFID, he has been on OT and Speech for two years, (mostly for speech, had delay but 1st grade teacher was the one that confirmed our suspicious of autism when she mentioned it for us to add OT to speech) He has improved so much, on trying new foods, to wearing clothes that used to be a no texture for him, to having better communication and eye contact. We still working with him with changes,  he does not handle big changes well, as well change of schedule or plans, as well as tones of voices or when people are lying to him or sarcasm. Along with other stuff. Food. Sounds. Textures. Academically he has no issues, Mostly social and interacting with others.\n\n But that's not the problem. \n\nHis OT and Speech ended with school because he \"graduated\" speech and since there was no diagnosis, OT no longer would be done in school. IEP was closed.\n\nStill continued to have OT and Speech weekly out of school and out of pocket. \n\nWe got confirmation of his diagnosis on the 7th of October, but since last month he has been getting in trouble in school, a lot, for talking back to teachers (Mostly teacher assistant, she's older and a stern lady) and even getting physical with others where he was always a peaceful kid. Some of the incidents are as follows:\n\nGot in a shouting match with the teacher assistant because she asked him to tell her about the book he finied reading, he said he finished it told her it was good but didn't want to go in detail. TA said if he didn't read the book then it would be no recess and he started yelling at her that he was not lying and he did read it but didn't want to talk about it. He had no recess and was notified by the school. We grounded him. \n\nSame TA got again in trouble by talking back to her.\n\nPushed a girl because she was \"bulling him by pointing and laughing at him.\" Got extended punishment and talked to about not putting our hands on people. \n\nDiagnosis came and went, then this happened \n\n\nHe got kicked out of robotics because he wasn't cooperating with others, which i understand, he is set in his ways on how things should be. But the way it was handled by the school officials irked me but I also understand.  He was not in one of the groups, he was making a robot by himself, as told by the teacher,  because he wouldn't cooperate with others, when he raised his hand to ask the teacher for help, she was busy, he went and tapped her to ask for her, she was still busy. He yelled at her that he needed help and she told him, in front of the team that he was kicked out of the team. Which made him throw a full tantrum and got laughed at by the teams and he removed himself and sat outside to wait to be picked up. Got punishment extended again. \n\nWe talked to him about it and told him maybe next year but that being disrespectful is not ok and that actions have consequences. I emailed the teacher to get more info on the event as well as to ask why we weren't notified that 1- he was isolated from being on the group, 2-that he was having issues we could've been notified and we could've pulled him from it and had a conversation with him about it before it got to that point. Nothing came of that, she just said it was a team effort and he didn't fit in\/work well with others, to try again next year.\n\nNext day had a meeting we had schedule with special needs director and teacher as well as therapists, talked about his emotional outburst and how we are new to the diagnosis, hoping to get OT back into in school setting to help for the mean time, still undecided on that school psychiatrist attended and said that we have go wait for something. For the mean time he was going  to be added to the counselors schedule to talk and decompress with her. \n\nAnother bad interaction with TA about recess being taken for school assembly video for anti bullying. \n\nTo the latest one being this morning. I got a call from the principal, she stated that he has had many issues, with disrespect and altercation with the TA, he got in a shouting because he got asked to do something and he didn't want to do it. Got sent to principal office and I got the call and principal said that she cannot have her staff threatening to walk out because of his disrespect, that the school (charter) is a sought after school and he cannot continue with this, that we had to have a meeting intervention or something to solve this. Which I told her that we did have a meeting the week prior, and that he was going to be put in schedule with school counselor while we wait for ABA therapy to be available. \n\n\nAt the moment we have no IEP or 504, since it was very vague for what is next steps on the meeting with SPED Director. He has no accommodations. I don't know what to do next. I'm at a loss and wits end. I know he can be disrespectful, sometimes he doesn't meant to but sometimes he does. I know he doesn't like the TA at all because he says she doesn't like him and she never wants to help. He has no issues with the main teacher. \n\nWe have the appointment pending with his pediatrician tomorrow, as well as OT. \n\nI applied to the nearest ABA for therapy. Is a waiting list \n\nI reached out to our local Autism association for any kind of guidance. Still waiting for email or call. \n\nI don't know what to do, I just want him to be successful and have a good time in school and learning. He has no friends and he knows this. He's a sweet boy that just overly emotional but still doesn't excuse his behavior. I'm just so lost, and alone on what to do. We have no one to turn to that has had similar issues.

Mind you their minds were already made up so it's not like I could disagree. At that time, I knew they were breaking civil rights laws against people with disabilities- if many don't know, its federally illegal and illegal per my state's regulation- taking a child's hours at school away for behavior is not legal, what needed to be done was adding Behavorial services and accommodations.

My boys go often, they do everything: water slides, buy things at concession stand, play with other kids, they have shown me they are responsible enough to have freedom within the pool gates. We met our friends there and Ethan was glued to his mom and didn\u2019t really play or socialize with my kids. My kids tried to include Ethan, but he wasn\u2019t wanting to venture off with them and they didn\u2019t press it.\n\nSecond, my boys were invited to Ethan\u2019s birthday party. My boys came and played. When we were about to leave, I led my kids over to say happy birthday to the birthday kid and thank him for inviting us. He didn\u2019t respond to our well wishes, instead looked at one of my sons and told him he didn\u2019t like something my son did when they were playing together, a fairly minor thing and my kid apologized. He didn\u2019t acknowledge my other son. It didn\u2019t feel as though Ethan cared if they were at the party or not, but it was clear that he didn\u2019t like that my son knocked over a tower. On the drive home my son (the one who knocked over the tower) said he didn\u2019t want to go to Ethan\u2019s parties anymore. \n\nBecause we know this family, I know that the family is concerned about Ethan\u2019s social growth and are thinking about ASD assessment but aren\u2019t there yet. \n\nI want to be respectful to Ethan and his needs.

So my son is in first grade. He\u2019s been receiving care from a neurologist for a few years now. She is adamant that he is not autistic but he\u2019s never had formal testing. She said he is too social and has good eye contact. My son is extremely shy at first but opens up faster to adults I feel like. He is diagnosed with ADHD and dyspraxia. ADHD medications have yet to help him however. This year has been particularly difficult with his anxiety. He has extreme meltdowns almost every school night about going to school the next day. He will say stuff like it\u2019s too hard, too boring, or too loud. He will say he\u2019s nervous all day but especially in the morning. He begs to stay home. He has difficulty focusing in school and is very fidgety. He will watch his peers instead of doing work or paying attention to the teacher.\n\nHe has poor emotional regulation skills despite me working on it with him for years. He will hit us or hit himself in the head when he gets upset. He has sensory stuff going on. He smells EVERYTHING even if he doesn\u2019t like the smell, he has to touch my hair constantly, he craves squeeze hugs, being rocked and swung. He has to run around a ton, he  fidgets with his clothes throughout the day, etc.  He\u2019s a very picky eater. \n\nSchool wise he is a decent speller and a good reader. Math and writing is where he struggles. He manages his behavior well enough at school but melts down at home.  For writing he just can\u2019t get his ideas down on paper, even if he can tell us verbally. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t get jokes at all. I think there\u2019s been maybe one or two jokes that I\u2019ve got him to laugh at. He cannot be the center of attention or he will cry. If the playground has too many kids he cries and begs to go home. He has terrible anxiety. He is seeing a psychiatrist mid November and is on a waitlist for counseling. On a waitlist for a sleep study.  He had genetic testing done and it resulted in no answers. He walked late, talked late but is now caught up on speech but does have a stutter at times. He\u2019s had a few different tics over the years but none currently. (Previously blinking, throat clearing) \nHis pediatrician and neuro are both saying it\u2019s not autism. He is in OT privately and they\u2019re currently working on his writing.  \n ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Autism_Parenting\/comments\/1gg2x1d\/should_we_ask_for_an_autism_assessment\/","main_id":"1gg2x1d","link_id":"","parent_id":"","body":"","created":"2024-10-31 01:19:25"}

I'm not saying I've observed many traits or behaviours associated with autism, just that so many people in my family are autistic, it's impossible to rule it out entirely.\n\nBut she's an early talker. By 12 months she was speaking in two word sentences and using AT LEAST 50 words (that I could keep track of). At 18 months she's speaking in four+ word sentences and I've entirely lost track of how many words she has. I know that's not normal. I work with kids her age, I've seen it all, and while some kids develop expressive speech earlier than others, she is (in the best way I can possibly describe it) just odd by comparison. She's even using pronouns correctly, and I know adults who can't even do that lol \n\nIt might just be that I spend more time around her than I do other kids her age, but I'm baffled by her. I know autism is sometimes associated with precocious speech, but is THIS the precocious speech they're talking about? \n\nAs previously stated, I haven't really noticed anything else going on that screams \"autism\" to me, but this one specific thing is just so weird and intense that I can't shake the feeling it must mean something. \n\nSome examples of things she's done this week that seem strange to me (for an 18 month old):\n-Counted to 10, using toys, correctly and unprompted\n-Pushed another child, then looked at her teacher when she realized she'd been caught and said, \"She's okay.\" (Cheeky little shit lol)\n-Recited the alphabet, also unprompted, perfectly from start to finish \n-Told me, \"I can do it,\" when I tried to help her take her socks off \n-Said, \"I see the owl,\" while on an 'owl prowl' \n-Sang MOST of 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star' with pretty good pronunciation (somewhat prompted; grandma started singing first and baby girl took the reins) \n\nThat's just since Monday.

One of my questions was did someone hit you like this? Did someone hurt you? And he said no I hurt Jake. I asked him when and he told me at his birthday. A few months ago we attended a birthday where he accidentally hit Jake with a toy and we apologized and moved on. He said this while hitting me. I told him it wasn\u2019t his fault and tried ways to calm him down. At one point I asked him do you want me to hug you or another option can\u2019t remember, and he said \u201chelp me\u201d, I clarified again and asked you mean hug you and he clearly again said \u201cno, help me\u201d.\n\nI tried a few more things which eventually helped him to get more regulated (deep breaths, blowing candles, counting to 20 slowly, and rocking on my lap).\n\nLong story short, not only is there an explanation to all the behaviour (ie: all behavior is communication). But also sometimes the behavior is because our kiddos get a bad\/uncomfortable thought and don\u2019t know what to do with it and their minds\/bodies act out the only way they know how, in an attempt to ask for help.\n\nThis was such profound insight for me.

Being an autism parent is spending everyday knowing you didn\u2019t do enough. Being an autism parent is explaining to the grandparents why their grandchild is so \u201chard\u201d when they actually come around. Being an autism parent is watching the way people look at you and your child when they\u2019re stimming and its loud and obnoxious, but they don\u2019t know any other way to deal with what they are feeling, it\u2019s not their fault but the world blames us, the world judges us. Being an autism parent is spending every waking moment thinking about things related to your autistic child. Being an autism parent can also be being a normal parent to a sibling and navigating two parenting styles and the fights they cause, the misunderstanding by the neurotypical that doesn\u2019t understand why brother gets to act one way, but I\u2019m required to act another and do more. (brother doesn\u2019t have to say please) Being an autism parent is trying to find a way to explain to said sibling why brother is older and doesn\u2019t talk. Being an autism parent is trying to balance the unbalencable needs your autistic child has and still trying to give your neurotypical child the time they deserve. Being an autism parent is doing everything possible to give your little ones the tools necessary to navigate this fucked up world because you\u2019re not always going to be around to protect them. Being an autism parent is snapping at your most loved little person because they\u2019re trying to process feelings they don\u2019t understand and it comes out as loud chaotic screams and cries that you don\u2019t understand but don\u2019t have the patience for because your still thinking about the bills that have been piling up on the kitchen table at a rate you can\u2019t comprehend given what life requires of you on a daily basis. You snap because you\u2019re stressed about the emails and communication you still haven\u2019t read or responded to from school, therapists, doctors, advocates, social workers, pharmacies, bill collectors, state and federal agencies. Then you finally get through another day and hopefully have a peaceful evening laying your most precious possessions in bed and spend the rest of the evening drinking yourself to death because you feel like the biggest piece of shit that\u2019s ever walked the planet for the way you acted towards this sweet wonderful vulnerable soul that you were blessed with bringing into this world. Being an autism parent is feeling like you are failing your child every single day. Being an autism parent is feeling like you are failing your spouse because life throws so much at you everyday that by the end of it you just want to be left alone. Being an autism parent is not knowing how to be there for everyone that relies on you and wants you. Being an autism parent is dealing with all the stress of a typical parent plus the added reality that this world is not kind and our littles are the kindest you\u2019ll ever meet. The world does not treat kindness well and you know you won\u2019t be here forever. Being an autism parent is taking everything the world throws at you, to break you, to defeat you, to destroy you.

I'm just seeking any insights, or helpful advice about other things we can try in order to both deal with and curb these undesirable behaviors and situations. \n\nTo add context, he's been in ABA before with a good therapist, but she switched jobs and we lost her. We tried again with other therapists, but they couldn't seem to build a relationship with him to get through to him.

He is very behavioral, he is verbal but not conversational. He aged out of the school system and has been without a day program for over a year, initially due to staffing issues and then once we did get a placement, he was expelled within two weeks for behavior issues. He needs constant supervision. He has done tens of thousands of dollars worth of damage to our home and property over the years. He is on four antipsychotics and a PRN benzodiazepine, but the meds do little to slow him down. Going out into the community is difficult due to impulsivity and lack of boundaries with strangers. There are poop smearing issues. At least three or four nights a month, he will just not sleep. He has gotten violent and is intimidating due to size (6\u20193\u201d 270 lbs). Sometimes I feel like my world is shrinking because I can\u2019t so much as take a walk or go to a store without making accommodations or risking bringing him. \n\nI guess my main question is, if you\u2019re the parent of an individual who presents similarly, have you found a day program that would accept your child and did it work out? Also starting to wonder if a stimulant ADHD med might help with the impulsivity instead of the antipsychotic cocktail. But I would also be so grateful for any other feedback or ideas.

My daughter (9) was recently diagnosed with autism by her school psychiatrist. She has always struggled with emotional regulation, but socially, although she has trouble with certain aspects, like losing games and conflicts with friends, she has always had lots of friends and enjoyed being around other children.\nI see that she may have certain characteristics of a girl with autism has but I don't agree with everything the psychiatrist said. She maintains eye contact with most people but the psychiatrist said she didn't.... there are other things but my real question is, the psychiatrist rated her as a 10 on the ADOS scale, which from what I understand is the most severe level but on the ASRS scale, the numbers mostly fall in the the normal range with 3 exceptions. I just don't understand how she can be so high on one scale while most of her other tests showed pretty average numbers. Which tests should I ask her outside psychiatrist for? I feel like this was thrown together a bit and the testing was done out of order. She did a ton of evaluation.

My son is 7 and has autism, since he was diagnosed I have spent Thanksgiving alone with him, while my husband (now divorced) all but twice went to celebrate with his family, bringing me Tupperware of leftovers so I can celebrate. I guess this was when I realized my son was the only family I had. The reason we didn\u2019t go wasn\u2019t for his comfort, it was because \u201che doesn\u2019t sit still and it\u2019s stressful for everyone around, I hope you understand.\u201d This has been all of my son\u2019s family, not just his dad\u2019s side. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re just blissfully unaware of how isolated that makes me feel, and how my son who is non verbal but capable of comprehension might feel hearing this, or if they just don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve made the best of the Holdiay over the years by watching movies and eating popcorn with him but this year I broke down. I was invited to Thanksgiving with family and was elated but they immediately rescinded their offer when they found out my son would be coming (as if his dad would watch him LOL). It hurts, I have never felt so alone in my life. How do other special needs parents handle the isolation? Especially the Holidays. How do you handle the sadness of your child being singled out as the problem?
